            <p><i>Awakenings Middle East magazine</i> was launched on 1 December 2012 by Tamara Pitelen, a New Zealand expat who moved to the UAE in 2006.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Awakenings started out as a labour of love. While still holding down a day job as a magazine editor for a Dubai-based financial publishing company, Tamara produced Awakenings on weekends with the help of good friends and her husband Adrian Maul. The aim was to provide a focal point for people living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who wanted information about alternative health options, eco-friendly living and a more holistic, planet-caring approach to life in the Emirates.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Tamara had worked in magazines and newspapers as a journalist, editor and writer for more than 20 years before launching Awakenings. Many centuries earlier, she started her career as a daily newspaper journalist on The Christchurch Press in New Zealand before moving to London and then Sydney and most recently Dubai.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The design of the magazine is done by Jun Jualag, to hire him for freelance work, contact him on
              <a href="mailto:jualag2002@yahoo.com">jualag2002@yahoo.com</a> </p><br>
            <p>The website was built by Shams Larbi, contact him on <a href="mailto:shams.larbi@gmail.com">shams.larbi@gmail.com</a> </p>
            <p>Awakenings magazine would not exist without the invaluable support and encouragement of Tamaraâ€™s employer CPI Financial, in particular CEO Adam Broom.</p>
            <p>Special thanks also goes to Asma Merchant, Aspen Aman, Neha Jamani, Samad Ahmad, Vanya Silverten, Shahida Siddique and Soniyaa Punjabi.</p>
