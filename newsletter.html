    <h3>To Live Longer, Cleanse Now!</h3>
    <p>We are exposed to toxins on a daily basis. We eat foods, drink liquids, and breathe air that contains many chemicals that are foreign and harmful to our bodies. The Western diet is filled with artificial flavours and additives, colouring agents, preservatives, pesticides, chemical fertilisers, hormones, and rancid oils. They accumulate in our bodies over the years and greatly compromise our health. In addition to foods our bodies are subjected to environmental chemicals on a daily basis.

                    <p>Soul mapping is a way to get down to your soul's desire. The technique uses archetypal images that have been carefully selected to go under the radar of the conscious mind. Talking about issues only that goes skin deep, but when you use images, music, or dance, the right-brain opens the door to deeper levels of intuitive knowing.</p>
