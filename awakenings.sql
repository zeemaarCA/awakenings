(7, 'Interview with Melanie Jane', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><strong>From the daffodil fields of northern England to the lavender fields of the South of France, Melanie Jane Nightingale is a lifelong fragrance and essential oil enthusiast.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s this passion that led her to become the founder of &lsquo;Masterclasses with Melanie&rsquo;, a fun and interactive aromatherapy workshop that started life in the iconic Dubai World Trade Club.<br />\r\nParticipants can gain insight into the fragrant world of aromatherapy and learn from Melanie&rsquo;s experience during the class. Melanie gives insider tips throughout the day while teaching the basics of essential oils, how to make them into beautiful blends and then put them into bath and body products to take home.<br />\r\nMelanie qualified as a Holistic Therapist in 1998 and recently studied at the Grasse Institute of Perfumery, she is also an associate of the Federation of Holistic Therapists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. How did you get into aromatherapy?</strong><br />\r\nI lost my father suddenly in 1993 when I was six months pregnant, which led to me suffering from postnatal depression. I wanted to feel better without medication, so I enrolled at the local college on an evening class and learnt how to wax legs! That led to me signing up to a one-year diploma course on holistic therapy. I discovered the power of essential oils after one of my fellow students made a blend for me using frankincense and the next day I felt like the sun was truly shining for the first time in ages. I still create a version of that blend called &lsquo;Morning Glory&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s a bestseller with my customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/By-Melanie-Jane-DSC_5636-edit-1-300x450.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. What is your favourite essential oil and why?</strong><br />\r\nLavender, even though I disliked the smell when I was training, I now can&rsquo;t live without it. Lavender helps me go back to sleep when I wake up at 2am. I use it on bugs bites, pimples or grazes. I use it to heal wounds or burns and I mix it with grapefruit for a toning body oil. Lavender enhances perfume blends too and is mostly undetectable, but adds a certain &lsquo;Je ne sais quoi&rsquo; to a fragrance.<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s such a versatile oil, I recommend that everyone should have a bottle by their bed and in their bag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. What tips would you give readers about incorporating essential oils into their daily lives?</strong><br />\r\nDo it wisely, do your research and don&rsquo;t Google recipes!<br />\r\nRead books and blogs by renowned aromatherapists like Robert Tisserand or Valerie Ann Worwood. Don&rsquo;t read blogs from non-experts as there is so much misinformation about essential oils and in the wrong hands that can be harmful.<br />\r\nOnce you have the basic essential knowledge, start slowly by using just a small selection of oils like lavender, bergamot, rosemary, mandarin and frankincense until you get more confident and make sure you dilute them in a carrier before use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Are essential oils for the whole family? What precautions should you take with using essential oils on children?</strong><br />\r\nYes, absolutely essential oils are for the whole family but not on toddlers under the age of 12 months. Lavender or chamomile water is fine for cranky infants, but not the oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential oils can be used as part of your everyday life and not just for ailments, you can diffuse them in oil burners to energise or relax if you don&rsquo;t fancy using them topically.<br />\r\nThere are many precautions with aromatherapy and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to do your research thoroughly, for example ylang ylang lowers blood pressure, peppermint might seem like a safe candy-like oil, but&nbsp;it interrupts the breathing pattern of infants so mustn&rsquo;t be used for children under three years of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People with medical conditions like cancer and low or high blood pressure etc or those undergoing chemotherapy or taking long-term medications should always consult their doctor before using essential oils, as there are some interactions that can be dangerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Is blending oils difficult? What&rsquo;s the easiest and most difficult essential oil product you can make?</strong><br />\r\nIt doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult if you start with two or three oils and work your way up. The most important thing is to look at what ailment you are creating the blend for, then seek out the benefits of individual essential oils and go<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Melanie_Jane_BAA_12.05.18-19-450x321.jpg\" />&nbsp;from there. Do you want something energising, balancing or healing? The next step is about creating a synergistic and attractive smelling blend, after all the aroma is the first thing you notice and the first part of the therapeutic process. This is what I teach in my classes and students are amazed by what they learn when it comes to blending successfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most difficult product to make is something for the face because the skin is so sensitive and there are many skin types and things you want to accomplish in effective natural skin care, this is something I teach in advanced classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Is it better that essential oils are organic? Does it make a difference?</strong><br />\r\nReally that&rsquo;s a personal choice, like buying organic or non-organic fruit and veg.<br />\r\nUsing non-organic oils certainly doesn&rsquo;t affect their therapeutic properties and there is no research to suggest otherwise at this current time, another thing to consider is that pesticides disappear a few weeks after spraying, so even if there is residue when distilling the oil, the level of it is miniscule; just a few parts per million.<br />\r\nCertified organic essential oils are more expensive simply because of the cost of certification, but you may find oils that are free from pesticides etc that aren&rsquo;t certified and buying them should depend on whether you trust them at their word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Tell us about the type of aromatherapy workshops you do and your plans for the future.</strong><br />\r\nI hold two types of workshops; aromatherapy and perfume. They are both very different.<br />\r\nThe aromatherapy concentrates on teaching the basics such as; history, origin, extraction, application, profiles and benefits of essential oils.<br />\r\nThe perfume workshops send you on an odyssey of over 50 exotic and rare oils, half of which are not used in aromatherapy. Participants discover the fragrance triangle and families as well as perfume classifications and learn how to create their own signature scent. I hold regular Perfume events at The Ritz-Carlton and combine an afternoon tea to add to the glamour.<br />\r\nBoth workshops are very hands-on, with lots of blending, experimenting and product making. It&rsquo;s my aim to make them fun and educational with lots of fascinating facts about the world of fragrance.<br />\r\nI also offer corporate and private events and my future plans are to hold more workshops and introduce them into the business sector for corporate wellness sessions &ndash; a compact session showing employees how to reduce their stress levels, feel more energetic or sleep better with essential oils. This invariably will lead to increased productivity and a healthier, happier workforce.<br />\r\nMy mission is to spread happiness through fragrance one workshop at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Do you have to know anything about essential oils to join a workshop?</strong><br />\r\nMy workshops are for everyone, even those who don&rsquo;t even know what an essential oil is, in fact I have all levels in each class, from people who know very little to those who work in related industries and they all go away with much more knowledge than they had before. I offer one to one guidance and that&rsquo;s why I keep my classes small, so everyone can benefit.<br />\r\nEveryone will go away with fascinating facts that they never knew they needed to know!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Where are the best essential oils from? Are they all from France or does it depend from oil to oil?</strong><br />\r\nWhere oils are from varies from oil to oil.<br />\r\nI would advise consumers to look at the country of origin of essential oils, this is much more important than concentrating on whether they are organic. The best oils come from the country they are native to because of the environmental growing conditions such as, climate, soil conditions, altitude etc. for instance the best lavender comes from the south of France, ylang ylang from Madagascar, bergamot from Italy, frankincense from Oman and so on.<br />\r\nYou can get good oils from other countries of course, someone I know swears the best lavender they ever found was on a tiny island inhabited by monks off the coast of Wales. I&rsquo;m going to find it one day and see for myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. What&rsquo;s the most unusual or expensive oil you use?</strong><br />\r\nThe most unusual oil I use is very rare and called ambergris or &lsquo;grey amber&rsquo; it has nothing to do with the fossilised tree resin called amber and actually comes from whale vomit! It is collected as it washes up on the shore. It smells as you would imagine it to, but blends beautifully in a perfume. I sometimes visit a secret vault in the perfume souk that has a treasure chest full of the dried ambergris and it costs AED 100 per gram.<br />\r\nI also use rose otto, which is extremely expensive because it takes around 36 roses to make just one drop of oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Melanie_Jane_BAA_12.05.18-64-450x320.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. What are the benefits of using essential oils?</strong><br />\r\nEssential oils work in harmony with your body, they can restore balance by detecting what your body needs by either stimulating, relaxing or healing.<br />\r\nFor instance, bergamot is excellent for anxiety and I dab a drop on my pulse points before any public speaking events. Spike lavender is excellent for scar healing and I made a blend for my husband after his neck operation, the results were staggering after only four weeks.<br />\r\nI don&rsquo;t believe that they are an alternative medicine, rather that they are complimentary. Modern medicine has its place, but I would rather people reach for a bottle of lavender than sleeping pills for their insomnia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. How much do the workshops and products cost? Please give ranges.</strong><br />\r\nThe workshops vary depending on the time, location, number of participants and products involved, a 3-hour session can cost around 300-400 AED plus materials for the products which range from 50-100 AED each product.<br />\r\nThe ladies club has a course run over two Monday mornings with four full-size products, including an organic body lotion, and that is AED 1,000<br />\r\nThe Ritz-Carlton perfume workshop is AED 500 for four hours including your own creation of an eau de parfum and an afternoon bubbly tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14. When did you start your brand?</strong><br />\r\nI started creating custom-made blends for customers after I qualified as a Holistic Therapist in 1998, but I didn&rsquo;t give it a name until I went public with it in 2011. It used to be called NightingOils (Nightingale and Oils combined) but the name wasn&rsquo;t memorable enough for most customers, so I rebranded in March 2016 to Melanie Jane and did my re-launch at the World Trade Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. How long do essential oils last for? Must you keep them in the fridge?</strong><br />\r\nYou don&rsquo;t necessarily have to keep them in the fridge, but they will last a lot longer if you do. Citrus oils go off quicker than others &ndash; around six months. Most other oils last between 12-24 months in normal conditions or up to five years in the fridge.<br />\r\nSome oils age well too like frankincense and patchouli, that goes darker and thicker over time, which is when I like to use it the most for perfumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16. Can you tell us a bit about the history of essential oils? How far back do we know about their use?</strong><br />\r\nContrary to popular belief essential oils don&rsquo;t date back to the Ancient Egyptians in 3,000 BC, they certainly used materials such as herbs, plants and resins for medicinal or religious purpose, but not essential oils, because the distillation method used to extract the oils wasn&rsquo;t discovered until the 9th Century by the Arabs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Melanie_Jane_RitzCarlton_30.06.18JPGS-39-317x450.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. How do you use essential oils? What ailments do you use them for?</strong><br />\r\nI use essential oils in so many ways, I use tea tree for mosquito bites, lavender for relaxing or healing, if I have flu I&rsquo;ll diffuse lemon and vaporise with eucalyptus and rosemary. I use my blends of Morning Glory if I feel a bit blue or Drama Queen if I have mood swings, which are more frequent due to me being premenopausal.<br />\r\nI love burning frankincense resin on charcoal too which eliminates negative energy and makes me feel very grounded.<br />\r\nLavender and rosemary in an oil burner is my favourite combination if I must concentrate when I&rsquo;m tired or have a deadline, the lavender calms me and the rosemary keeps me alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. What is your favourite scent?</strong><br />\r\nI have too many favourites for different reasons but at the top of the list is honeysuckle because of the perfume I created for my husband and frangipani, which is in the first perfume I created eight years ago. But I think Patchouli is my all time favourite because it reminds me of the mid 1980s when I was into heavy metal, me and all my friends used it neat and I often reminisce of a more carefree time when all I had to worry about was catching the last bus home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. What would you say to someone who was sceptical about the effectiveness and benefits of essential oils?</strong><br />\r\nMy favourite phrase is &lsquo;If you believe in aromatherapy it works, if you don&rsquo;t believe in aromatherapy, it STILL works.&rsquo;<br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s a lot of scientific research behind essential oils and a lot of chemistry, in fact I recommend reading about the chemistry of them to give yourself a better understanding of their benefits.<br />\r\nFor instance, there has been research that proves the use of rosemary essential oil improves the cognitive function in Alzheimer patients, grapefruit is shown to reduce abdominal belly fat with regular massage and carrot seed oil promotes liver cell regeneration.<br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t underestimate the power of a delicate flower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melanie Jane Nightingale</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Founder/Creative Genius</strong><br />\r\n<strong>www.masterclasseswithmelanie.com</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>www.bymelaniejane.com</strong><br />\r\n<strong>www.facebook.com/melaniejaneboudoirfragrance</strong><br />\r\n<strong>www.twitter.com/by Melanie Jane</strong><br />\r\n<strong>www.instagram.com/melaniejaneboudoir</strong></p>\r\n', 'Melanie_Jane_BAA_12.05.18-32-702x336.jpg', '2019-08-08 05:51:47'),

Are they effective?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many stores offer different brands of natural toothpaste, but is it better than the toothpaste you&rsquo;ve always used?<br />\r\nUltimately, the basic functions of toothpaste are the same no matter what flavour or brand you choose to buy, but here are the key differences between &lsquo;natural&rsquo; toothpastes and traditional toothpastes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.) Sweeteners: natural toothpastes are often sweetened with xylitol or stevia, while most other toothpastes use saccharin or other artificial sweeteners<br />\r\n2.) Fluoride: there is a lot of anti-fluoride talk, and those who oppose its use believe it unnatural or unsafe. For this reason, many natural toothpastes contain no fluoride. All other toothpastes use fluoride as an active anti-cavity ingredient<br />\r\n3.) Animal Testing: most toothpastes are tested on animals, but natural toothpastes are not, as a rule<br />\r\n4.) Dyes: natural toothpastes are often white or off-white, containing no artificial coloring. Non-natural toothpastes contain bright blues, reds, greens, and other safe (but unnatural) colours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should we be cautious about products if they are not organic?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingredients are very important. Certain harsh detergents and various other ingredients may have potentially harmful side effects, whether natural or chemical. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or the antimicrobial agent triclosan should be on your &rdquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; list.<br />\r\nHowever, be aware that even natural ingredients can have harmful side effects. Plants and herbal extracts have potent medicinal properties, and many so-called &lsquo;natural&rsquo; toothpastes also contain harsh preservatives and abrasives which can make your teeth sensitive and may have nothing to do with preventing tooth decay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluoride or no fluoride?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluoride is a natural mineral found throughout the earth&rsquo;s crust and widely distributed in nature. Some foods and water supplies contain fluoride. It helps prevent cavities in two different ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Fluoride concentrates in the growing of bones and developing teeth of children, helping to harden the enamel on baby and adult teeth before they emerge<br />\r\n2. Fluoride helps to harden the enamel on adult teeth that have already emerged</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluoride works during the de-mineralisation and re-mineralisation processes that naturally occur in your mouth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; After you eat, your saliva contains acids that cause de-mineralisation &ndash; a dissolving of the calcium and phosphorous under the tooth&rsquo;s surface.<br />\r\n&bull; At other times when your saliva is less acidic it does just the opposite, replenishing the calcium and phosphorous that keep your teeth hard. This process is called re-mineralisation. When fluoride is present during re-mineralisation, the minerals deposited are harder than they would otherwise be, helping to strengthen your teeth and prevent dissolution during the next demineralisation phase<br />\r\nWhat can be harmful is the excess of fluoride, that&rsquo;s why it is very important to check with your dentist to know how much you or your children should be exposed to. He/she will then advise you on the type of toothpaste you should use and the amount of fluoride you need. It is particularly important for children as they often swallow the toothpaste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Andrew Culbard<br />\r\nCosmetic &amp; Restorative Dentist<br />\r\nDr. Roze &amp; Associates Dental Clinic<br />\r\nWebsite: www.drrozedentalclinic.com</p>\r\n', 'unnamed-5-450x418.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:19:25');

Michael Jackson.&nbsp; King of Directors?&nbsp; Steven Spielberg.&nbsp; Prince of Pop?&nbsp; Justin Bieber.&nbsp; King of Rock and Roll?&nbsp; Elvis.&nbsp; The ingenious Prince,&nbsp; lead singer of Queen, Freddie Mercury, even Queen Latifa.&nbsp; But what about the Queen of the Catwalk?&nbsp; Naomi Campbell.&nbsp; All Dog Signs!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does that mean for you in the Dog year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it might help you to perceive yourself as royal and do what you want your way.&nbsp; Bring your personality to everything you do and be uncompromising about it.&nbsp; Reveal who you are.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s special about you!&nbsp; And Dog will be impressed.&nbsp; He just wants to see who you really are, how your colours shine.&nbsp; At times, the coming year may feel like a cartoon, full of fun, frolics and just a hint of outrageous drama, but that&rsquo;s what you get when you&rsquo;re dealing with the Iconoclast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An old Chinese proverb says, &ldquo;Dogs are born old and grow younger by the day&rdquo; and they can be recognised by their eternally youthful personalities, looks and ability to connect with young people.&nbsp; This youthful outlook is one of the strongest influences one may feel in 2018.&nbsp; With the Dog&rsquo;s confidence many may be inspired to finally take that balloon ride or go rock climbing or do that special thing they&rsquo;ve always wanted to do but feared that the time had passed.&nbsp; It is the year of the underdog so &nbsp;major feats (especially creative ones) can be achieved.&nbsp; It is a favourable time for small ventures to expand, to launch new brands and a good time to take risks.&nbsp; It may also see changes in humanitarian policies with regards to minorities of any kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a sign full of contradictions, the Dog influenced year can be complicated and meeker signs may find themselves tapping into a plethora of emotions they may find uncomfortable, yet, empowering.&nbsp; Dogs also have a darker side but they aren&rsquo;t particularly afraid of it, in fact, they kind of love it.&nbsp; Hence, why, many explore the darker aspects of their characters.&nbsp; The key is moderation and not to impose any extreme puritanical ways upon oneself so that repressed feelings don&rsquo;t express themselves in strange ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the twelve signs, the dog is the guardian, so for those the dog favours, (ie the Rabbit, Horse, Tiger and Boar signs) they can expect to have an extended party of a year because the dog protects you from difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dog year has more than its fair share of serious issues, politically there may be revolts, rebellion and public humiliations as the Dog diligently hunts for the truth in order to serve justice.&nbsp; Many get their comeuppance as the Dog can be ruthlessly objective when called in to play judge.&nbsp; Despite the Dog&rsquo;s ability to be impartial and objective when they observe other people&rsquo;s circumstances, many still take things very personally.&nbsp; So expect people to be a tad touchier than usual too and it might be wise to have a mechanism in place to handle it when people to trigger you.&nbsp; This is a year to be bold and courageous, challenging yourself to challenge yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Rat:&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Rats</strong><br />\r\nWilliam Shakespeare,&nbsp;Mark Zukerberg, Simon Fuller,<strong>&nbsp;Cameron Diaz</strong>, Ben Affleck, America Ferrera, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Marlon Brando, Mozart, Freddie Prinze Jnr., Yves St Laurent, Jennifer Garner, George Washington, Rebecca Romijn, Mandy Moore,&nbsp;<strong>Antonio Sabato Jnr.</strong>, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Jonny Lee Miller,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Dragons, Monkeys, Ox<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Horse</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the instigator, the fire starter, the beginning.

Through me you will see colors you have never seen before, experience delights you have never experienced before, I am the one who knows the way to Eden, follow me, I&rsquo;ll take you there. Gracious am I if you value my time, my voice and my contribution; be blind to my gifts and be blind to your own ignorance. I direct you to your own guidance, open you to your own intuition, lead you from the barren lands to the oasis because I know my world intimately; its structure, material and its effective usage. I should know, I was here before all else. I am the oldest sibling. I am the first born of the Chinese Zodiac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Rat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers</strong>: finance, medicine, law, science, politics and the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A complicated year lies ahead as you feel like you are on an unending treadmill. Just when you&rsquo;re done with one thing, something else will crop up and you will find yourself wasting precious time on petty unnecessary issues. You may find that superiors or people you respect may start criticizing your work more than usual or in a different, more intense manner that you may find offensive or hurtful. Don&rsquo;t take it personally and recognize that it&rsquo;s genuinely an attempt to push you to greater perfection. If you rise to the occasion, you will be rewarded, just don&rsquo;t take the route of indifference or reactive anger as the Dog rewards patience and perseverance, not revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Ox</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1913, 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Oxen:</strong><br />\r\nPrincess Diana,&nbsp;Margaret Thatcher, Meg Ryan, Bill Cosby, Michael Douglas, Kate Moss, Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney, Napolean, Clark Gable, Robert Redford, Vincent Van Gogh, William Butler Yeats, Peter Sellers, Vanessa Redgrave, Dustin Hoffman,&nbsp;<strong>Aishwarya Rai</strong>, Barrack Obama, Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon, Peter Gabriel, Meryl Streep, James Marsden, Jim Carey,&nbsp;<strong>Dave Chappelle</strong>, Eddie Murphy,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Snake, Rooster, Rat<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Sheep</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the sturdy rock of the cycle, the immovable object, the monolith! The world is my charge and I alone am responsible for its improvement. Waking before dawn I graft until after sunset without uttering a word. My diligence is noticed and I am given increasingly greater responsibility as well as greater resources; now I set the rules; do as I say, but only do as I do when you stand in my shoes; you&rsquo;ll need unending resolve, military discipline and seductive charisma. My presence and humor cast an enchanting spell that makes me irresistible. The masses want to follow me, do what I ask and enjoy my dominance! I control my external world because I am but an alien in my emotional one, pretending that feelings don&rsquo;t exist doesn&rsquo;t work, so the emotional arena seems to be my steepest learning curve, but I&rsquo;m already halfway up the hill and as everyone knows I keep going until I reach my finish line: I either win, or I end. There is no alternative option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Ox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers:</strong>&nbsp;stand-up comedians, actors, carpenters, managers, mechanics, sculptors, teachers, architects, real estate and politics, gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may think that things are bleak and miserable, but they really aren&rsquo;t. The troubles you see and expect are all in the mind and you&rsquo;ll soon realise the sun is shining brightly on you. Things will be made easier for you and circumstances will allow a high degree of creativity at work. You&rsquo;ll find that people are being unusually co-operative and you will not need to use a heavy hand, in fact, avoid it, because it will spoil things. Money isn&rsquo;t great but has been worse recently so you can&rsquo;t really complain. Entertaining on a large scale may be required and an unexpected journey&nbsp;lead to entertaining adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Tiger</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1914, 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Tigers:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong>, Tom Cruise,&nbsp;<strong>Leonardo Dicaprio</strong>, Ryan Phillipe, Joaquin Phoenix, Robbie Williams, Hilary Swank, Demi Moore, Alyson Hannigan, Natalie Imbruglia, Alanis Morrisette, Marilyn Monroe, Sheryl Crow, Jewel, Victoria Beckham, Stevie Wonder, Beethoven, Robert Pattinson, Usain Bolt, Ralph Fiennes, Elizabeth Banks, Jon Bon Jovi, Julie Walters, Lady Gaga, Hugh Hefner, Lindsay Lohan, Leah Michele, Dr Phil, Louise Hay, Bradley Cooper,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with</strong>: Horse, Dog, Boar<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Monkey</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am passion personified with more confidence than I can keep up with. Curiosity has nearly killed me a million times, but I&rsquo;m quick on my paws and love the thrill of the game. Calm on the surface, a storm on the inside; nobody understands the enigma that I am, I feel so much, I care so much, but I need my freedom even more! Wealth, status or fame, rarely impress me as these cat-eyes see bullshit for bullshit. Earn my respect, give me the truth and I&rsquo;ll infuse you with my energy, a rush of a trillion stars that flow from my veins into yours. I can fuel you when you&rsquo;re depleted, I can excite you when drabness threatens: my aliveness revives even the dead. As a feral cat, expect the unexpected, but also know that what I really want is to be tamed&hellip; actually, I&rsquo;ll never be tamed but I&rsquo;ll let you think I am. I&rsquo;m the impulsive, independent, improviser; the lone warrior, I trust myself and myself alone, even if I love you, I&rsquo;ll always be alone in my Tiger-ness, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Tiger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers:</strong>&nbsp;musicians, singer-songwriters, lawyers, dancers, sports, teachers, journalists, politicians, PR workers, military positions, and jobs within science and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dog creates an environment in which you flourish so you find yourself with all your buttons pressed on. &nbsp;This can lead to bouts of hyperactivity because of all the stimulation and excitement. &nbsp;The barriers come down and the world becomes your oyster. Career prospects sky rocket&nbsp;and your finances stabilise. &nbsp;Relationships mature and sone sort of rite of passage is possible. &nbsp;Of course, if this cat is still curious, it&rsquo;ll find itself embroiled in a few scrapes here and there but will escape with all nine lives intact; so when you play,&nbsp;play hard. Luck protects the Tiger folk this year, although still prone to the occasional&nbsp;bout of self-pity&nbsp;from imagined unpopularity, it&rsquo;s important to remember to put yourself out there as influential associates are waiting to lift you up. &nbsp;Active, creative and busy, decide now to make the following year (Boar year), your time time to rest and give this Dog year your all. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be more than worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Rabbit</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1915, 1927, 1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Rabbits:</strong>&nbsp;David Beckham, Andy Murray, Whitney Houston,&nbsp;<strong>Angelina Jolie</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Brad Pitt</strong>, Johnny Depp, Robin Williams, Mike Myers, George Michael, Rodrigo Santoro, Blake Lively, ingrid Bergman, Tobey Maquire, Lauren Hill, Eva Longoria, Dermot Mulroney, Drew Barrymore, Lisa Kudrow, Ian McKellen, Kate Winslet, Eva Cassidy, Zac Effron,Tori Amos, Albert Einstein, Arthur Miller, Orson Welles, Quentin Tarantino, Sri Devi, Mel B, Emma Bunton, Zeenat Aman, Kangana Ranaut, Tina Turner, Nicholas Cage, Jane Seymour,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Sheep, Boar, Dog<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Rooster</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the sensual Casanova, the seductive siren and the political artist. With aristocratic manners and cultured flair I waltz through my world wanting to inspire greatness in others through my own amazing talents, yet hoping that nobody embarrasses me by highlighting my genius. It separates me from the mere mortals but I am one too and I see the greatness of being regular. But for some reason, this bunny is placed on a pedestal even though I am not the sort that likes to be paraded for the sakes of entertainment, well, not for too long anyway&hellip; I have real work to do. My art is my life and I do it to elevate consciousness to an unearthly plane, for some divine interruption, occasionally intervention for I bridge the real and surreal worlds. I am the psychic channel that communicates with spirit that is why the future flows from me. I just know that which is beyond psychology, beyond philosophy and beyond regular comprehension &ndash; I am of this world but my mind is beyond. Because I&rsquo;m noble, responsible and divinely beautiful, don&rsquo;t mistake me for an angel &ndash; I choose not to live up to anyone&rsquo;s expectations and will hop away in the blink of an eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Rabbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the end of your opposite year, the Dog brings welcome comfort. Your nerves can relax as the Dog&rsquo;s influence is one you understand and can work with. Especially since this is the sign of your Soul Mate. It is a great time for romance and all things love. Be careful of getting too comfortable though as you may find there are a number of surprises that crop up, mostly positive and a few you probably saw coming but did not know how to manage. You may find yourself frustrated the behavior of superiors or peers, but don&rsquo;t lose heart, keep on keeping on and you will eventually reap the rewards you deserve. Generally, it is a relaxed year with no major problems and much to experience on an emotional level. Focusing on fun, lightness and your creative pursuits will place you in an ideal situation to let your natural beauty shine. You will find love showered upon you from all directions. Enjoy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Dragon</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1916, 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Dragons:</strong>&nbsp;Calista Flockhart, Emma Stone, India Arie, Keanu Reeves,&nbsp;<strong>Sandra Bullock</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Bruce Lee</strong>, Sean William Scott, Reese Witherspoon, Courtney Cox Arquette, Rupert Grint, Lewis Carroll, Salvador Dali, Mae West, Sigmund Freud, John Lennon, Florence Nightingale, Alicia Silverstone, Patrick Stewart, Patrick Swayze, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexandra Burke, Adele, Jessie J, Wayne Dyer, David Icke, Colin Farrell, Benedict Cumberbatch, Joss Whedon, Roald Dahl, Josh Waitzkin, Martin Luther King Jr, Maya Angelou, Joseph Campbell, Shakira, Rihanna, Ryan Reynolds,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat, Monkey,&nbsp;Rooster<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Dog</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the spiritual messenger, the motivator, the mythical monster that channels the sun from within. All know I breathe fire, but what they know not, is that fire comes from a sun that burns in my belly, connects to the suns of the universe and amplifies my charge a million-fold. It is the source of my infinite power and functions on every plain, physical, mental, spiritual. I am a gift to mankind. I came to serve man&rsquo;s mind; to enthuse, to enliven and enlighten for I tread where no others can reach. I run, I climb and I fly. That is why I am beyond comprehension, sometimes even my own, but my inner sunshine god guides me to my next odyssey. Adventure to adventure I expand my experience, then I mirror it back to the world in shades they can see, in shapes they recognize, for I am the everyman in a beautiful beasts shell. I do not need to speak to impassion, my presence is enough, I do not need to touch, my presence is powerfully experienced, I do not need to take any action, my presence is every thing. I am nature&rsquo;s purest secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Dragon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year of the Dog favors the unprivileged and those who usually have to struggle to be seen or heard. Unfortunately, this is not you. In addition to this, the Dog is your opposite sign which means that this could be a tough year. You may notice that every six years you go through important changes, this usually happens in your own year of the Dragon and then its opposite sign of the Dog. These changes, although tough, are never beyond you and somehow you&rsquo;ll always derive a positive outcome from them. This is one of those years, so be prepared, don&rsquo;t rely on your presence or your luck to get you through. Call in friends or associates to handle the confrontations and remember to see the humour in the trying moments. &nbsp;You may find yourself having to function without your presence and regal powers so humble yourself and be prepared to be one of the civilians. It will not last for long, but while you&rsquo;re in the Dog year, tow the line and do not expect special treatment. &nbsp;That being said, there is always opportunities to be found within any obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Snake</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Snakes:&nbsp;</strong>Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Michelle Gellar, James Van Der Beek, Kevin Williamson, Michael Fassbender, Linda Evangelista, Tim Ferriss, Liv Tyler, Cindy Lauper, Daniel Radcliffe, JK Rowling, Tom Welling,&nbsp;<strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, Iyanla Vansant, Barbara Walters, Lata Mangeshkar, John Malkovic, Taylor Swift, Peter Krause, Ronan Keeting, Samantha Morton, Ruby Wax, Brittany Murphy, Famke Jansen, Kanye West, Pierce Brosnan, , Tony Blair, Charles Darwin, Bob Dylan, Gandhi, Greta Garbot, John F Kennedy,&nbsp;<strong>Robert Downey Jr</strong>, Abraham Lincoln, Jacqueline Onassis, Pablo Picasso, Shania Twain, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan (actor), Dick Cheney, Chris Rock,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Ox, Rooster, Monkey<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Boar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the mentor, the political philosopher, the teacher. My life is my example to inspire you. My great ego endows me with power, influence and persuasive prowess but I must choose my path; for karma afflicts me powerfully and my deeds are read from the circumstances of my life. I am the mysterious strategist and there are only ladders for me to climb as I am the snake that can bring others down, or, if I choose, I can also be a ladder to support the growth of others. Though I am quiet, calm and wise, my anger, when released, creates earthquakes. Though my mystique is well acknowledged, my weakness is my need to be admired, seen as the ultimate sophisticated being. My words are sometimes tools and sometimes weapons, be my friend or my foe, you will be affected by my rhetoric. I breathe, I sweat and I bleed power &ndash; there is always more inside me than I release and I will never give it up until the time comes for me to shed my current skin and renew myself once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Snake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the Dog, many Snakes also have the vice of an addictive personality, so in a year where there are temptations all over, you must exercise your willpower in order to maintain your health. You can still have fun, but everything in moderation. The Dog lays out a mini adventure playground that you enjoy and it can really help to push you along in your current career path, but beware you don&rsquo;t get trapped. Sometimes things go missing for Snakes in Dog years but if you take this as a sign that the old is leaving encouraging the new and fresh to enter then that is exactly what you will invite. Let yourself indulge your interests this year, art, fashion and music are expected to be prolific so your involvement (in all ways) would be encouraged by the barking guardian. Generally, it&rsquo;s a productive year where you may entertain, be entertained and travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Horse</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1918, 1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014, 2026,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous Horses: Katie Holmes, Cindy Crawford,&nbsp;<strong>Halle Berry</strong>, Annie Lennox, Rowan Atkinson, Angus Deaton, Joshua Jackson, David Schwimmer, Nelly Furtado, Emma Watson, Aaliyah, Aldous Huxley, Spike Milligan, Nelson Mandela, Paul McCartney, Tammy Wynette, Martina Macbride, Genghis Khan, Isaac Newton, Rembrandt, Theodore Roosevelt, Neil Armstrong, Barbara Striesand, Chris Everet, Sally Gunnal, Will Young, Gael Garcia Bernal,&nbsp;<strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>, James Dean, John Travolta, Kristen Stewart</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Tiger, Dog, Sheep.<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the humanitarian rebel, the brave savior, the noble fighter. I am swift and agile and need space to roam. I crave freedom; therefore obtain it for others.&nbsp;&nbsp; With my external yang spirit and internal yin life, I present to the world an eternal contradiction, even though I maintain nature&rsquo;s perfect balance. I am 100% instinct! That is why I present such an inconsistent front. I require sole exploration. I want to know who I am without prior definition. I want to live life with blood coursing through my veins a million miles per hour because it suits me, because I know I&rsquo;m the only one who can handle it, because anything other than that is death. That is why I have this raw instinct, invisible antennae and reflexes: I was born with speed so I can live on the edge because that is where I belong! Pushing my own boundaries and that of society. If that pushes your buttons at the same time, deal with it! My job is to equalize the status quo, not make you comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the year that you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Every sign has one year where the fates bless you generously and for the horse, it&rsquo;s always the year of the dog. The air is softer, music sounds better and you find joy in everything. You may get a promotion, get noticed by influential people, make more money than you expect and have a blinding time during all of this. The dog creates an environment so attuned to your way of being that you can actually feel the changeover from the roosters strict, petty ways to the relaxed, laid back and fun environment that immediately begins at the end of January. You&rsquo;ve earned it. Enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Sheep</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Sheep:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Julia Roberts</strong>, Pamela Anderson, Nicole Kidman, Mira Sorvino, Clare Danes, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Matt Le Blanc, Mena Suvari, Christina Ricci, Brandy, Guy Pierce, Heath Ledger, Andy Warhol, Sally Jesse Raphael, Billie Jean King, John Denver, Andrew Carnegie, Napoleon Hill,&nbsp;<strong>James Mcavoy</strong>, Michelangelo, Laurence Olivier, WH Auden, Nat King Cole, Thomas A Edison, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Chow Yun Fat, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Jamie Callum, Kurt Cobain, Kelsey Grammar, Sarah Mclachlan, Reba Macintyre, Harry Connick Jr, Jason Statham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rabbit, Boar, Horse<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Ox</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the social artist, the subconscious scientist, the compassionate innovator. My calmness, tender countenance and warmth invite all to love me. That is why I am often family favorite, the golden child, the chosen one. Though I may seem docile and malleable, I let you think what you want so that your needs are met and I can be free to be unconventional me. I experience the greatest&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;in my daydreams, for it extends the self in this tangible realm. I am not easily understood for what I understand is the un-understandable. I am the connection to subconscious worlds, to unknown realms and to divine plans. I feel it, I sense it and then I know it. I pull magic from my dreams and manifest it into tangible reality. I take my intuitive esotericism and add it to my emotional awareness to become the ultimate human behavior expert. Though I can be spoilt, frivolous and expensive, you will never feel more at home than when I am there, for I am&nbsp;<em>home</em>, I am comfort, I am your woolen security blanket&hellip; and I&rsquo;m worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Sheep!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a playground for others looks like a mine-field to you, but fear not dear fluffy Sheep, once you acclimatize, you will see it for the party it actually is. The biggest issue is that of fear, as the Dog challenges all to move onwards in their lives in a dramatic and powerful way. For you this may mean challenging the status quo in your romantic life, financial issues and family pressures. Conserve your energy and remain positive, as things are not as bad as they seem. More than any other year, you will be encouraged to put yourself first and prioritize your own needs. If you choose to put others first at this time, you may find that your good intentions might be taken advantage of and taken for granted. Do not make any long-term financial commitments or spend money on risky ventures. In this highly creative year, you may make headway towards a professional goal that you&rsquo;ve long been working towards. But make sure it is your vision. When in Rome, do as the Romans do&hellip; in the Dog year, put yourself first!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Monkey</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1920, 1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Monkeys:</strong>&nbsp;Jerry Hall, Giselle Bunchen, Lucy Lawless, Michael Douglas, Michael Schumacher, Roseanne Barr, Will Smith, Julia Sawalha, Brendan Fraser,&nbsp;<strong>Christina Aguilera</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hugh Jackman,</strong>&nbsp;Justin Timberlake, Kim Catrall, Ashanti, Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, Julius Caesar, Winslow Homer, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonardo da Vinci, Bette Davis, Celine Dion</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat, Dragon, Snake<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Tiger</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the most evolved of the cycle, I see the obvious and I turn it into comedic music, for I am the agile imp, the cheeky chimp, the naughty nymph. Naughtiness is present in my every gesture, my eyes wink without moving and I project sexiness without trying. But I am more than just a passing fancy, for within me is balance that all my astrological siblings lack; some may share my wit, attractiveness, a few have a presence I do not, but what they lack is a firm, grounded common sense and that I have in spades.

Forget 20/20, I have 50/50 crystal clarity. It frustrates me that the rest of the world lags so far behind; my creativity captivates the masses as I bore of my own edgy magic. My convictions are titanium. I need not external validation for I have greater inner resources. Many come to me for validation; oh how I pity those fools!

Sometimes, I know not where I am or where I stand but am committed to figuring it out. Time is an enigma for I live partly in the past, partly in the present whilst tipping a trotter into the future for a peek. I live not for myself, but for my tribe. No role is beyond me, regardless of my gender, for my love comes without boundaries.

Also, some in the&nbsp;circles you walk in may find&nbsp;success earlier than you this year, which may cause a bit of bitterness; your biggest enemy though, is your overactive imagination which lowers your vibration if you let it.

This outpatient procedure promises to kick-start skin&rsquo;s deadbeat collagen and put it on high speed rewind, reversing nearly a year&rsquo;s worth of ageing per month over the following six months. With advocates such as Jennifer Aniston, Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow and Christie Brinkley all looking so much younger than their years, is there any wonder why Ultherapy is so popular! Dr. Tracy Mountford&rsquo;s Clinic has been voted the &lsquo;Number One Ultherapy Clinic the UK &amp; Ireland&rsquo;. Dr.Tracy has also been named &lsquo;Best for Fillers&rsquo; in Tatler magazine, and is known for her weekly column &lsquo;Nip &amp; Tuck&rsquo; in the Daily Mail.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Ultherapy is the only FDA cleared technology, to lift the face in a single treatment giving swift, durable and impressive results.&rdquo; | DR TRACY MOUNTFORD EXPLAINS&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The past few decades have seen huge advances in the area of non-surgical skin treatments and no more so than in the technologies available to help those who are looking to lift and tighten skin, without resorting to a surgical face lift. Although many of these innovations have made bold claims in the past, Ulthera is the first and only energy based device to be cleared by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for a non-invasive aesthetic lift indication. The FDA is the US body that is responsible for assuring the safety and efficacy of all regulated medical devices, including those in the aesthetics industry. In addition, Ultherapy has been certified with the CE mark in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultherapy uses ultrasound, the same technology used to scan pregnant women, to deliver heat to lift and tighten skin on the&nbsp;face, neck and d&eacute;colletage. The Ultherapy device produces ultrasound in two different ways, the first is like the one used for baby scans and sees beneath the surface to help map a patient&rsquo;s unique skin layers and plan treatment. The second type is that used for treatment and has higher thermal energy intensity and is more focused. This is delivered via a handheld device, in just one session lasting no more than 90 minutes, with no downtime, no needles and no scalpels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial effects can be seen within days, more sustained changes within two to three months and improvements up to one year post-treatment. In some people, these results can last for more than a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tracy-Mountford-PR-image-copy-296x450.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:296px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Mountford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is it that makes Ultherapy so special? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bespoke treatment,&rdquo; says Dr Tracy Mountford, (MBBS, MBCAM), founder and medical director of The Cosmetic Skin Clinic, who has been offering the procedure to her patients in her London practice and flagship clinic in Buckinghamshire, for the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ultrasound imaging allows you to see each individual patient&rsquo;s skin, which in turn allows you to set the machine so that the energy is delivered to exactly where you need it in the skin,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The treatment is precise, targeted and focused. The practitioner can visualise different levels in the skin, right down to the muscle layer in order to deliver the energy exactly where we want the sculpting and lifting to occur. This is unique to Ultherapy and means I can tailor the treatment plan for each of my patients.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s long been known that heating the lower layers of the skin can stimulate production of collagen, the protein that&nbsp;gives skin its firmness. Until now, however, it hasn&rsquo;t been possible to tailor delivery of this heat energy to each patient. Not only can Ultherapy do this, but it does it at three different levels, not just one, without heating the top layers of the skin. In this way, Ultherapy treatment avoids damaging the surface of the skin and surrounding tissue which allows patients to resume their normal daily life immediately after the procedure and without any particular post-treatment care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During a treatment,&rdquo; says Dr Mountford, &ldquo;the device is set to deliver focused energy to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; different levels of the skin. The first is the area of muscle that surgeons tighten during a face lift. The second targets the deep dermis where it stimulates the body to produce more collagen, and the third and final one works on the superficial layer of the skin, where the heat energy causes an immediate lifting effect, due to the proteins in these layers contracting. This sort of approach doesn&rsquo;t just give an effective result, but perhaps most importantly, a natural looking one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial effects of Ultherapy can be seen within days, more sustained changes within two to three months and improvements up to one year or more post-treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As evidenced by the research carried out by Merz Aesthetics, the company behind Ultherapy in the UK, patients don&rsquo;t necessarily want to look much younger, they want to look fresher,&rdquo; says Dr Mountford. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about looking fresher, rather than &lsquo;done&rsquo;, and Ultherapy helps me to achieve that. As part of a holistic approach, I might combine it with injectable products and the great thing is it can be used with other treatments.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Ultherapy could be used on anyone from their 30s to 80s, the best results tend to be on those between 40 and 60, who are starting to see laxity around the jawline, neck or d&eacute;colletage. The d&eacute;colletage is an area where a lot of women are having Ultherapy because it lifts and tightens very quickly and this area is a notorious giveaway of age and can often age prematurely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Patient selection is important,&rdquo; says Dr Mountford. &ldquo;The worst thing a practitioner can do is over-promise and under-deliver; however, with Ultherapy this is simply not the case. In the last year, our clinics have treated approximately 500 patients with Ultherapy, and both the results and patient satisfaction levels have been outstanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, a treatment is only ever as good as the practitioner, and so training and education are an important part of the support that we receive from Merz Aesthetics. We&rsquo;re constantly refining and updating the protocol to ensure that every patient has the best experience, and gets the best result possible.&rdquo; says Dr Mountford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ultherapy-pic-2-copy-450x318.png\" style=\"height:318px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before &amp; After</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly this approach seems to be working. While Ultherapy is never going to replace cosmetic surgery, it is the perfect solution for patients who either can&rsquo;t have surgery or are reluctant to have it. It&rsquo;s also a flexible treatment option that can be used before or instead of a surgical face lift, but may also be used to maintain the lift effect of more conventional face-lift surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder, with all these things considered, that Ultherapy is becoming ever more popular with practitioners and patients alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nowadays it&rsquo;s all about looking the very best you can look and this technology certainly delivers,&rdquo; says Dr Mountford.</p>\r\n', 'shutterstock_507630193-copy-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:19:31'),

There are many factors that are involved in living a healthy and fulfilling life while looking and feeling good. Diet, of course has a huge impact on our health now, probably more than ever, with everything that is going on in this planet of ours&hellip;vegan all the way I say! Exercise is of paramount importance to me and it should be to you too. It regulates blood flow, oxygenation of our body and the feel good endorphin factor. It keeps you strong, mentally and physically, and it helps relieve stress. The side effect of all of that, is a good looking, fit body. who doesn&rsquo;t want that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, what people fail to realise is that &lsquo;pro-ageing&rsquo; is first and foremost, emotional health. When we are stressed, unhappy, sad, angry, anxious or frustrated, the first place it shows is on our face and our energy levels. Hence, I choose to work in a way that doesn&rsquo;t just improve the exterior of a person but the whole mind, body, Spirit of a person.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_146098490-copy-427x450.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:427px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use Altearah Bio Colour therapy in my facial treatments, which determines how you are feeling in the moment. It works with the subconscious mind, so it is 110% accurate.

Then I use a crystal bed to help relax and absorb negative energy, and lastly reflexology while the mask is on. Topping all of that off with grade A, first class professional Organic and Clinic skincare lines.

The food itself is also so satiating that you will last for hours without snacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Decreased Blood Sugar and Increased Insulin Sensitivity</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This reduces the risk for diabetes, and can even reverse it.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Increased Energy</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through improved mitochondrial function and lowered free radicals, you&rsquo;ll experience a vitality like never before.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Reduced Risk for Cancer</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Cancer cells live off glucose and grow from high insulin levels. Since a ketogenic diet is low in carbs and results in lowered insulin levels, it starves the cancer cells. Thus, the diet reduces the risk for cancer and is even being used to treat some cancer forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Ketogenic Diet Checklist &ndash; How to Succeed!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Low carb: Avoid carbs and sugar, such as bread, pasta, and sweets. Instead, opt for high-quality protein, healthy fats and vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Food types: Preferably choose organic, whole foods and grassfed meats and wild-caught fish to avoid toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Carb refeed: Many benefit from some good carbs (such as carrots or sweet potato) occasionally. The Bulletproof Diet is a variation of the ketogenic diet, which includes a carb refeed about once a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Meals: Get a ketogenic cookbook or google some recipes, to ensure that your new diet is enjoyable and thus sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Warning: If you have any existing health condition, consult your doctor before trying the ketogenic diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Intermittent fasting: It&rsquo;s optional, but works well. Limit your eating window to 6 hours, for a daily detox and accelerated weight loss. Since the ketogenic diet is so filling, it&rsquo;s easy to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example of a Ketogenic Menu</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_409787926paint-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breakfast: Bulletproof Coffee, which is toxin-free coffee beans mixed with grass-fed butter and Brain Octane.

(16, 'Can your Mind Heal your Body', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Our mental state, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and attitudes, can positively or negatively affect our biological functioning. In other words, our minds can affect how healthy our bodies are! Numerous clinical studies have been conducted that point to the fact that people who have a positive outlook on life, are optimistic, with healthy personal and social relationships, and have minimal stress are less likely to become sick or diseased.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mental states can be fully conscious or unconscious. We can have emotional reactions to situations without being aware of why we are reacting. Each mental state has a physiology associated with it, a positive or negative effect felt in the physical body. On the other hand, what we do with our physical body (what we eat, how much we exercise or even our posture) can directly impact our mental state. The mind and body are essentially inseparable: The brain and peripheral nervous system, the endocrine and immune systems, and indeed, all the organs of our body and all the emotional responses we have, share a common chemical language and are constantly communicating with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stay Healthy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very generally speaking, health comes from &ldquo;natural&rdquo; [holistic]living, which means healthy expression of feelings, wholesome nutrition and clean, harmonious and loving inner and outer surroundings, in short, living as close to untampered-with nature as possible &ndash; while carefully avoiding natural and man-made toxins. Health, even when compromised by cancer, can be restored and healing can be achieved, as evidenced by many cancer victors. As one works at re-establishing these conditions to the best of one&rsquo;s ability, cleans, heals, harmonises and balances one&rsquo;s body, emotions, mind, spirit and environment and applies those remedies that honour the first injunction to all working in the healing field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&rdquo;If you believe you can, you probably can. If you believe you won&rsquo;t, you most assuredly won&rsquo;t. Belief is the ignition switch that gets you off the launching pad.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;DENIS WAITLEY, MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is cancer on the rise?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many suspected root causes: for example, there is strong evidence that the depletion of our soils due to intensive farming beginning with the industrial revolution has led to widespread mineral and trace element deficiencies leading to (or promoting) in their turn numerous ailments including cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another cause is likely to be found in the dangerous harsh chemicals present in our polluted food, air and water supply, ranging from pesticides to artificial hormones (present in meat and dairy from non-organic husbandry), as well as in the ubiquitous electro-magnetic fields from appliances, cell phones, computers, TVs, microwaves etc. All of these are assaultive, unnatural substances and influences our bodies have to contend with on a daily basis without, and this may be a crucial point, having had the evolutionary time to adapt to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tandem with this onslaught of toxins works the widespread intake of devitalised, demineralised, industrially produced food low in nutrition and high in calories, far removed from what more naturally-living and much healthier peoples consume, another&nbsp;major suspect in the genesis of cancer. Many seem to compound the problem by the intake of medicinal drugs and noxious substances, themselves all too often the contributing cause of disease and worse, even death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also reason for the contention that all disease has a psychosomatic causative agent if not root cause, in other words stress and inner wounding in all of their multiple forms. A similar idea has been expressed by those such as Traditional Chinese Medicine who claim that all or most disease is due to or based upon a blockage of &ldquo;energy&rdquo;, leading to a corresponding weakness in the organ and/or system affected by such undersupply of &ldquo;vital energy&rdquo;. Healing Cancer Naturally is indeed a proponent of the &ldquo;energetic&rdquo; viewpoint of disease and healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What may be the solution to cancer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many authoritative sources believe that disease can only develop and thrive in a body which is lacking in nutrients and/or energy (which may be depleted due to stress, nutritional/mineral and other deficiencies as well as due to other factors) as well as laden with various toxins. According to this thinking, by remedying deficiencies, cleansing the body and re-establishing a healthy energy flow, disease can and will be reversed. As one naturopathic physician writes, medicine tends to perceive cancer as a specific localised condition, which a specific drug (or herb) will counteract. According to him and others,<strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;it is far more appropriate to approach this condition as a manifestation&nbsp;of systemic disease, and use such systemic treatments as are appropriate in aiding the body to regain control&hellip; What is required, is an approach to transformation &ndash; change in body, mind and spirit &ndash; which is possibly the only effective context in which to treat cancer.&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mind Power and Mental Influences are Important for Successfully Manifesting One&rsquo;s Goals, including Healing From Cancer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, even so-called terminal cancer has been healed solely through the power of the mind. A placebo is a medicine or other kind of treatment that seems therapeutic, but is actually inert, or empty. It is pharmacologically inactive. It works only if you believe it will. Even though placebos lack chemical value and are often just a sugar pill, they have a very real effect in 30% to 40% of patients which include cancer patients. The fact that people respond to placebos is one of the clearest examples in medicine that the mind has a major effect on the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&rdquo;The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly. &rdquo;</strong>BUDDHA, PHILOSOPHER</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_350880479paint-450x321.jpg\" style=\"height:321px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Positive vibes only</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The truth is that scientists are beginning to understand how the brain communicates with the body right down to the cellular level.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The common idea that DNA determines so much of who we are, not only our eye or hair colour, for example, but also our addictions, disorders, or susceptibility to cancer is a misconception. You find yourself to be more or less a victim of your heredity. The problem with that belief system is that it extends to another level. You become irresponsible. [You say,] &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything about it, so why try?&rsquo; This concept &ldquo;says you are less powerful than your genes.&rdquo; A person&rsquo;s perception, not genetic programming, is what spurs all action in the body: It&rsquo;s actually our beliefs that select our genes, that select our behaviour. The human body is comprised of 50 to 65 trillion cells. Cell functions independent of DNA and its perceptions of environmental stimuli affect DNA. This also applies the same principles to the human body as a whole, showing the power our perceptions, our beliefs, have over DNA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MOST EFFECTIVE NATURAL CANCER TREATMENTS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1 THE GERSON THERAPY AND JUICING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 90 years ago, Dr. Max Gerson developed one of the most effective natural treatments to cure cancer called &lsquo;&rsquo;Gerson Therapy&rsquo;&rsquo;. He helped hundreds of patients activate naturally their body&rsquo;s magnificent ability to heal itself. The therapy included &ndash; Organic, plant &ndash; based foods, raw juices, coffee enemas, beef liver and natural supplements. The Gerson Therapy not only helps in treating cancer but other diseases as well such as arthritis, allergies, heart diseases and many more, by naturally boosting the body&rsquo;s immune system. With the combination of food, juices and natural supplements the immune system kills tumor tissue and helps flush out toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2 THE BUDWIG PROTOCOL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Budwig Diet Protocol is a specific diet, which was developed by Dr. Johanna Budwig in 1952. She discovered that processed fats and hydrogenated oils were destroying our cell membranes which caused toxins and diseases. This protocol was believed to have 90% success rate. Dr. Johanna discovered that by replacing processed fats and oils with saturated/ unsaturated fatty acids, the cells rejuvenate and rebuild themselves. She found that consuming a mixture of cottage cheese &ndash; which is high in protein, flax seeds &ndash; which contains unsaturated fatty acids, and flaxseed oil has great results, since the body is able to absorb the rich nutrients easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3 FRANKINCENSE ESSENTIAL OIL THERAPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/frankinsence-oil-for-cancer-page-paint-1-450x337.jpg\" style=\"height:289px; width:386px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frankincense has been used for the last 5,000 years and has been effective in treating many diseases, infections and even brain tumors. This ancient medicine, is believed to have cancer &ndash; fighting properties and research shows frankincense&rsquo;s cancer &ndash; fighting abilities. According to researchers out of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, the potential cancer-killing effects of frankincense are due in part to its ability to influence your genes to promote healing. Baylor cancer scientists emphasise that this potency makes Boswellia Serrata or frankincense effective for preventing and treating cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4 THE SUN AND VITAMIN D</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dozens of studies have found that vitamin D and sunshine has helped protect against prostate, skin, colon, and lung cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Best Way to Get Vitamin D</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To best prevent breast cancer, research suggests you should supplement so that your vitamin D3 levels are at least 40-60 ng/ml and up to 80 ng/ml. Here is how you can get the best results:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Expose 40% of your body to the sun between 10 am and 2 pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Consume oral supplements of vitamin D3 daily, containing 5,000 &ndash; 10,000 IU. Since they are fat soluble, make sure you take them with healthy fatty foods containing coconut oil or probiotic rich drinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5TURMERIC AND CURCUMIN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turmeric has been used for thousands of years in India and China. It is known for it&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory properties and helps treats several conditions such as toothache, jaundice, urinary tract infection, colic , menstrual discomfort and many more. A number of studies on cancer cells suggest that curcumin does have anticancer effects. It is believed to be able to fight cancer cells and prevent more from growing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is considered to be most effective against breast cancer, bowel cancer, stomach cancer and skin cancer cells. It has also been studied that the combined treatment of curcumin with chemotherapy has resulted in more elimination of bowel cancer cells than chemotherapy alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6 MEDITATION AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_318128108paint-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:319px; width:478px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many individuals are using meditation and alternative therapies such as Vipassana Meditation, Reiki, Theta Healing to treat cancer. There is a connection between the mind, body and soul. Mind &ndash; body therapy is shown to restore the balance between mind, body and soul and creates healing &ndash; spiritually, mentally and emotionally. These non-invasive treatments have been used for years and have proven to be effective. Chinese Healing and Qigong proves to dissolve cancer tumors as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition many research studies that have been conducted on the healing benefits of prayer, maintaining mental peace and a positive outlook are absolutely critical to cancer prevention and treatment. Whatever your preference, make sure you focus on living a stress-free life filled with gratitude and joy.</p>\r\n', 'shutterstock_151156943paint-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-27 05:31:55'),

MARIE-CLAIRE WESTGARTH</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food allergy is not the same as food intolerance, but the two are frequently confused. A classical food allergy (such as peanut or shellfish allergy) is usually characterised by an immediate and often severe reaction of the immune system to exposure to a specific food. Food allergy is quite rare with only about 2.5% of the population being diagnosed with the condition. The most common instances of food allergy are to peanuts, tree nuts (almonds and brazils), eggs, milk, fish and shellfish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SO WHAT EXACTLY IS FOOD INTOLERANCE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not life threatening like a food allergy, food intolerance should never be underestimated as its impact on sufferers can be significant, severely impacting on their ability to live normal healthy lives. The most frequent intolerance nowadays is Gluten. Food intolerance is extremely widespread and it is estimated that 45% of the population could be affected. Many people with food intolerance experience more than one symptom. Symptoms can often be vague and the root cause of the problem is food,and it is not always correctly diagnosed.

We eat foods, drink liquids, and breathe air that contains many chemicals that are foreign and harmful to our bodies. The Western diet is filled with artificial flavours and additives, colouring agents, preservatives, pesticides, chemical fertilisers, hormones, and rancid oils. They accumulate in our bodies over the years and greatly compromise our health. In addition to foods our bodies are subjected to environmental chemicals on a daily basis.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the onslaught of environmental toxins, we are faced with naturally occurring wastes produced by our body. Free radicals, which are formed when normal oxygen molecules lose an electron, damage our bodies. While the body is accustomed to a number of free radicals and normally deals with them adequately, too much exercise, excessive stress, and a toxic system can cause an over-abundance of free radicals that puts a strain on body cells, leads to premature aging, and causes damaging effects to health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE RISKS OF TOXIC BOWEL:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also face the risk of being poisoned by a toxic bowel. Poor food choices, food allergies, full spectrum antibiotics that kill natural intestinal flora, constipation, and the overgrowth of detrimental bacteria create a condition called autointoxication. In a compromised state, the bowel is unable to rid the body of toxins, so they are reabsorbed into the blood stream. These excess toxins and undesirable bacteria interfere with proper enzyme function, which in turn prevents normal cell activity, particularly in the brain and nervous system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the bowel is slow in emptying its waste, other organs of detoxification such as the kidneys, liver, lungs, lymph system, and skin become overworked and exhausted. The liver, in particular, shifts into higher activity, producing large amounts of age-promoting free radicals. A toxic bowel hampers all phases of liver detoxification. In this overburdened state, the body is no longer able to rid itself of wastes. Energy levels suffer, and eventually sickness and disease occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, symptoms of toxic overload are mild to moderate. Fatigue, obesity, skin rashes, sore throats, sinus congestion, headaches, depression, hives, constipation, and frequent colds may all be symptoms of toxic overload. Many of these symptoms are mistaken for other health problems and are treated with medications that increase toxin levels. The root of the problem, toxic over load, continues to be ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE LIVER&rsquo;S ROLE IN DETOXIFICATION:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The liver is essential to detoxification. It must eliminate toxins that are taken into the body from the environment, created by the body, or reabsorbed into the blood from a toxic&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_224940757-2-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" />bowel. This is why it is important to cleanse the bowel before or in conjunction with cleansing the liver. There are several ways that the liver helps with detoxification. It filters the blood to remove toxins. It also produces bile, a substance that carries many toxins to the bowel for disposal. Fiber in the bowel absorbs the toxic bile and eliminates it from the body. Another way the liver cleanses is by producing an array of essential enzymes that help to break down toxins, rendering them harmless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as toxins enter the liver, they can be filtered, combined with bile, disassembled, or converted into less harmful substances by enzymes before being excreted out of the body</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you are exposed to toxic chemicals on a regular basis or for extended periods of time (such as when painting a room in your home during the winter and there is no way to assure proper&nbsp;ventilation), you should eat foods rich in glutathione or take oral supplements. Fresh fruits and vegetables are your best good sources of glutathione.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE LYMPH SYSTEM AND DETOXIFICATION:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lymph system is comprised of lymphatic vessels that run parallel to the blood veins in the body. The vessels of the lymph system are filled with a fluid called lymph that is collected from the space between the cells in the body. The lymph fluids feed the cells of the body by transporting various nutrients such as salts, minerals, and proteins to every cell of the body. Likewise, lymph fluid carries cell wastes and debris that accumulate from normal cell function away and turns them over to the blood. The blood shuttles the wastes to the kidneys, lungs, colon, and skin for elimination. The lymph system can be thought of as the cellular toxin disposal system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lymph fluid travels to nodes found in various places in the lymph system. There are over six hundred lymph nodes in our bodies, with a particularly large concentration found in the neck, groin, armpits, and abdomen. Immune cells called macrophages are found in the lymph nodes. They engulf and destroy many foreign and toxic particles. Lymph nodes also contain b lymphocytes that produce antibodies to protect the body from future viruses, bacteria, yeast, and other organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a healthy state, lymph nodes are about the size of almonds. However, when they are overloaded with excess toxins, they swell and become painful. This occurs when the body experiences colds and infections. The lymph system is vital in helping to fight disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to keep the lymph system healthy is to eat foods that do not cause excessive congestion. Excessive and<br />\r\npartially digested proteins, highly refined foods, excessive sweets, and dairy increase lymphatic congestion. Limiting these foods improves lymph function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to keep the lymphatic system function is through regular exercise. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system does not have a pump. The contraction of the muscles in the body keeps the lymph fluids flowing. The work of feeding the cells and removing toxins is imperative. Keeping the lymph system in optimal condition is a big influence on your state of health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common Health Signs that You Need to Detoxify &ndash; Frequent, unexplained headaches or back or joint pain, or arthritis, chronic respiratory problems, sinus problems or asthma abnormal body odor, bad breath or coated food allergies, poor digestion or chronic constipation with intestinal bloating or gas, brittle nails and hair, psoriasis,<br />\r\nadult acne, or unexplained weight gain over 10 pounds, unusually poor memory, chronic insomnia, depression, irritability, chronic fatigue, environmental sensitivities especially to odors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing the overall health improvement of the body is essential to obtaining optimal health. Just as you change the oil in your car on a regular basis, proper cleansing should be practiced at regular cyclic intervals. Cleansing the colon and liver is the first and most important step when beginning nutritional programmes to increase overall well-being (or weight loss). Having healthy lymph function acts as a major protection against environmental and internal toxins. Cleansing or fasting and detoxification has been a part of healing protocols for centuries and is more vital today than in any period of history because of the hostile environment we live in. For longevity and health, cleansing is a must!</p>\r\n', 'shutterstock_548242675edit-e1502195370895.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:45:16'),
(19, 'Body Love â€“ A Combination of Internal & External Beauty', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><em>Highly renowned and Dubai based plastic surgeon&nbsp;</em><em>Dr. Luiz Toledo is a leading light in the ever changing field of cosmetic procedures. With a wealth of experience and a stellar reputation which he has deservedly earnt through time, he is the elusive mix that UAE residents trust when making the decision when and if to have invasive or non-invasive procedures.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media bombards us with images of beautiful people who appear to have it all. This leads to us asking questions like&hellip; If only I had a flatter stomach, then I would feel comfortable in a bikini. If my nose was smaller, would I be more confident. Dr. Toledo performs hundreds of cosmetic procedures for these very beauty concerns. But, he&rsquo;s also here to tell you, &ldquo;not so fast,&rdquo; when it comes to your internal &ldquo;if only&rdquo; dialogue. As much as surgeons love to perform surgery, sometimes it is not the answer and not in the best interest of a patient.<br />\r\n<strong>BEAUTY AND SELF-ESTEEM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beauty is a powerful thing. attraction to beauty is hard wired into humanity&rsquo;s DNA, so there&rsquo;s no escaping the fact that beauty truly does matter. It is inescapable and natural to desire beauty, and there is no doubt that increasing physical beauty can increase one&rsquo;s positive body image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we need to remember is that beauty is not the only aspect that needs to be addressed for a healthy self-esteem. Many people try to work on the external beauty without addressing the internal beauty&hellip;. This is impossible as the two are entwined in a spiral relationship, and a balance is the key to success. A positive body image is achieved in many ways, including diet, exercise, surgical or non-invasive procedures. A combination of these is powerful and achieves long lasting results. Sometimes, unflattering physical characteristics like asymmetric breasts, loose skin after pregnancy, disproportionate facial features or physical deformities cause mental anguish and aren&rsquo;t treatable with diet and exercise alone. These individuals are good candidates for surgical procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dr Luiz, how long have you been practicing, and when did you open your surgery in Dubai?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been practicing as a Plastic Surgeon for more than 35 years and have been involved with the teaching and the organisation of Congresses around the world for almost as long. I started working in Dubai and the Middle East initially as a visiting surgeon in 2004, settling permanently in Dubai in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is clear that surgery is an excellent option for many men and women who want to bolster their self-esteem. In your experience after performing countless procedures, do you find that your patients have a better sense of wellbeing after procedures/surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am happy to say that yes, the majority of my patients have a better sense of wellbeing after the surgery. From the start we discuss all options available, patients expectations and realistic outcomes, this allows us to decide upon the best and most appropriate procedure. Thereafter it is a case of the surgeon using his experience and technical skills to deliver the results. Patient expectation is one of the big questions that need to be understood and addressed fully during the initial consultation. There are many occasions when the patients&rsquo; expectation cannot be met, for example, undergoing a breast implant surgery will probably not win back your husband. Similarly, a patient expecting the results of a facelift, but only willing to undergo Botox injections and fillers can only be disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In your consultations with patients, what is the process of evaluating how best to achieve their goals, and when to progress from noninvasive to invasive surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the consultation, we will of course discuss the patient&rsquo;s goals for the surgery if that is the route we decide to go. Often a patient will bring in a photograph of the look he or she wants. This is helpful and I can immediately evaluate if this is going to be achievable or not. The non-invasive techniques, although not entirely, are best suited to younger patients. Invasive surgery is usually prescribed for the older patient where skin quality and laxity is becoming an issue.<br />\r\n<strong>What type of approach do you have when you preparing your patients for surgery?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the procedure is agreed upon, we explain in detail the postoperative journey to be expected and how the patient is now required to enhance the surgeons&rsquo; work by following closely the instructions given. Post-op visits to the clinic are scheduled and need to be honoured so the surgeon can keep a close eye on the recovery process. Pre-surgery tests are done and the patient always has a consultation with the anaesthetist. We offer a computer imaging consultation so the patient can understand the limits of the surgical technique and the surgeon can verify if it is possible to achieve the patient&rsquo;s expectations. This is particularly helpful in nose surgery. We offer all kinds of pre and post op help to our patients such as lymphatic drainage, skin care before and after the facelift and more. All patients are educated and advised on how to best maintain their new form through post-operative care, this coupled with an intelligent diet and exercise routine ensures the best results.<br />\r\n<strong>In the ever changing world of cosmetic procedures and technologies, are there any that you feel are outstanding (cutting edge or tried and tested), and which achieve the best results?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can say that I have been using Coolplas (cryotherapy for localised fat deposits) now for 5 years with very good results. We can now offer our patients, who are reluctant to go into surgery, an option to reduce local fat deposits with the use of this machine.</p>\r\n', 'Toledo-portrait-copy-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:19:55');

It has three main functions: protection, regulation and sensation. We forget that it is not just the skin on the face that needs attention but the full body. As an Aesthetician, of course, the face takes priority but just for a moment let&rsquo;s think about the body, what can we do to keep it smooth, hydrated and wrinkle free?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best things you can do is exfoliate with salt scrub mixed in with coconut oil, olive oil or almond oil (I make and sell my own with essential oils). It has several functions; it eliminates negative energy around the auric field, smoothes the skin and moisturises at the same time with the use of the oils; it saves you from&nbsp;using a separate moisturiser and leaves your skin super soft. As a guide exfoliate a few times per week but not too often and less so if you have sensitive skin as it can be a little too much. This will do wonders for the texture of your skin it will make you feel alive and cleanses the aura into the bargain. Do it after you shower while your skin is still wet, then let the water run over your body to wash away the salt just leaving the nourishing oil behind, then pat yourself dry.<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/low-res-beauty-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Body moisturizers are just as important as face creams to keep the skin smooth, soft and tight. Nourishing is the word for the body as it is definitely not as well taken care of as the face and we tend to get very dry as we are covered up or sun exposed, neither particularly good. Body creams with AHA are also a good idea as they naturally exfoliate the skin keeping it fresh and renewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming back to the face, a proper daily routine is a must and the younger you start the better! Simple cleansing and toning with a moisturiser or a moisturising sunblock for teens, no need to go any higher than SPF30, after that they become quite chemical which could lead to other problems like acne or pigmentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Girls over 25 need to start with cleanser, toner, moisturiser and perhaps even an eye cream, I&rsquo;ve always maintained that prevention is better than cure!! After 30 start getting into the specific serums for skin type and<br />\r\ncorrection. By the time a person reaches 40 this is the age where you can tell how well they have looked after themselves! Although I will say it is never too late to reverse the ageing process, there is always a way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serums are always a fast way to get quick results as they penetrate quickly into the skin and target specific problems like pigmentation, acne, wrinkles and so on. The golden rule is they go on after the toner under the moisturiser. Nowadays we are fortunate that a lot of professional skincare companies do one cream for day and night. This saves the ordeal of looking for a day cream and a night cream but to play devil&rsquo;s advocate, a day cream is to protect whereas a night cream is to nourish. Although at night everything in the body slows down, everything to do with the skin speeds up and this is where the regeneration process takes place hence needing a more nourishing cream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional products versus over the counter products. In general professional products spend money on the ingredients whereas over the counter products spend on marketing and packaging. Professional products will always have much more active ingredients and this is where the difference lies. Quicker, better, longer lasting results, hands down. Your skin is a living organ just remember that! If you want to keep looking good as you age you can quite easily just take a little time to give back to you through using good skincare products, having regular facials (of course!), eating well, drinking lots of water, exercising and getting a good nights sleep!</p>\r\n', 'beauty-scrub-low-450x300@2x.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:20:08'),
(21, 'Eating Mindfully', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em><strong>We all eat every day, and the food we choose can be a powerful influence on our wellbeing, health, energy and mood. How we eat is just as important. Mindful attention to the simple act of eating has the potential to transform your health significantly&nbsp;for the better. Eating mindfully promotes a healthy body weight, more conscious food choices, and healthier digestion. It also ensures optimum absorption of nutrients, optimum energy from what you eat, and increases self-awareness. | WORDS BY PHOEBE BOONKERD</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat slowly, chew food well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one food habit that you should adopt long term, this is the one it should be. Chew each mouthful to a liquid state before you swallow and put your eating utensils down between mouthfuls. This gives your digestive system a chance to communicate to your brain more effectively that you are full and also gives you a chance to listen to that signal, resulting in smaller portion intake.<br />\r\nWe are more likely to overeat when we gulp our food and do not chew. Proper chewing initiates digestive enzyme secretion, and increases the surface area of food, resulting in improved nutrient absorption and digestion. Try eating slowly, chewing each mouthful up to 20-40 times</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hara Hachi Bu to you!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a cultural habit &ndash; Eat until 80 Percent Full &ndash; practiced on the island of Okinawa, Japan, one of the world&rsquo;s most healthiest and long-living population groups. Studies show that those who practice Hara Hachi Bu consume 30% fewer calories than average, or who practice Hara Hachi Bu, actually age more slowly and live longer. This light under-eating at each meal also optimises digestion and reduces common symptoms such as gas, bloating, belching and other discomforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nourish your body with as many high quality foods you can afford or obtain. Your body is the vehicle in which you travel through life, and it deserves the best fuel so it serves you well into the future. The human body needs an abundance of plant foods, mostly vegetables as the dominant food group, supplemented by quality proteins, good fats and a smaller proportion of grains and root vegetables. Eat a rainbow of colour and variety of foods every day. This is the foundational principle of healthy eating and as a general philosophy, and as a lifestyle choice it is the golden rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time your meals well, and always eat breakfast</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to start your day with a healthy breakfast &ndash; make time to savour and enjoy it &ndash; smoothies, juices, organic eggs, wholegrain porridges, grainy bread, avocado,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and fresh or sauteÌed vegetables are all great options. Overall, increasing the volume of vegetable intake in favour of carbohydrate staples (bread, rice, pasta), and maintaining a protein food at each meal supports balanced energy and a healthy body weight. Eat sensible sized portions approximately every 4 hours, allowing a healthy appetite for each meal. 3 meals plus an afternoon snack is a pattern that suits most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make sure there is a &lsquo;fast&rsquo; to break!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, make sure that the time between dinner and breakfast is a 12-hour fast. Digestion slows down at night, and we need fuel for the day. This simple fact means that the body is designed for a healthy, good-sized breakfast before 9am, a substantial lunch before 1pm, and a light dinner that finishes by 8pm for the body to renew, detoxify and rest as we sleep. It&rsquo;s best to stop eating 3 hours before sleeping. If your schedule is far away from this ideal, do what you can to gradually shift it. If you must eat late, vegetable soup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is recommended, as it is easy to digest, filling and less likely to burden your system, which promotes weight gain and &lsquo;morning fog&rsquo;. If you aren&rsquo;t hungry for breakfast, you probably ate too much, too late the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat to live, rather than live to eat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy eating can be applied to what the Taoist philosophy calls &lsquo;going in two directions at once&rsquo;. This means, in one direction, focus on eating healthy food, get organised, sort out how you can logistically eat healthily, who is preparing it, to what recipes, and what you plan to eat, and then, and in the other direction, let food go a little, don&rsquo;t make it the main focus of your life. Eat mindfully in the act itself, and then get on with your daily tasks, forget about food for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avoid poor combinations or foods that burden your body</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have digestive problems, this is especially important, and you may get a lot of insight from a food and symptom diary. Fruits should be eaten alone, or before meals, never after, as this compromises digestion and encourages gas. Avoid drinking a lot of fluid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>with your meals as this also compromises digestion. Take notice the effects of the foods you eat, and avoid foods that you associate with discomfort or excessive fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food intolerance testing is very useful for ascertaining individual sensitivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about cravings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugar and carb cravings are a symptom of poor nutrition and fatigue. The intensity of cravings can be used as a barometer of how stressed, fatigued or poorly nourished you are. A more balanced eating plan can be of great assistance in preventing this. Sleep, emotional issues and stress are also essential to address and have a direct effect on cravings, eating patterns, and body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much is enough?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have slightly different needs in terms of portion sizes, but it is safe to say that many of us overeat routinely, which makes<br />\r\nus lose our sense of how much we should actually eat. To re-connect with this, one of the best techniques is to eat slowly. Another helpful technique is to use your own hand as a guide. This gives a good estimate, based on your body size:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PER MEAL:<br />\r\nProtein foods: the size and thickness of your own palm, or a handful of non-animal proteins such as beans and tofu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-starchy vegetables: 2-3 large handfuls (2 cooked, 3 raw)<br />\r\nCarb staples: as much as could t in your own cupped hand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fats: no more than your first three fingers- size portion of nuts or seeds or 1 tablespoon of cold pressed oil per meal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You are what you eat!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a plain fact! Eat lots of starch and simple sugars (bread, pastries, candy, chocolate, alcohol, potatoes, etc.) and you will become overweight (excess sugars in the body are converted into fatty acids which are stored as fat). Eat fried food and not only are you saturating your body, arteries and veins with gunk, but that gunk is in a free radical state. You&rsquo;ve heard of free radicals right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s telling you to avoid</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>by taking anti-oxidants. Well even better, combine our with high heated Trans-fat oils (as in French fries, donuts, fritters, etc.) and you have a recipe for obesity, Diabetes, and chronic disease. YOU NEED to eat fruits and vegetable if you are going to be truly healthy. That&rsquo;s a fact! Learn to immerse yourself in the wonders of the plant kingdom. You&rsquo;ll glow for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat in peace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating in stressful environments, such as over your keyboard, an argument or intense conversation, a TV show, in a mindless haze in the car, or when you are stressed or upset is hard on your digestive function and promotes digestive disturbance, overeating, too much of the wrong foods, guilt, and a bad relationship with food as a crutch for stressful emotions. Eat in a place where you can be calm, with minimal conversation of light topics, if any. Create a feeling of ceremony, with some aesthetically appealing table settings, bowls, and implements. Treat eating as an important act, and a chance to relax 3 times a day. Savour the moment, the environment,<br />\r\nthe company (even your own) and the flavours.</p>\r\n', 'Eating-mindfully-small-702x336.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:37:24'),

This is the basis of epigenetics, a new frontier in medical science. By Tamara Pitelen.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago, the general belief was that if something was &lsquo;in your genes&rsquo; you were stuck with it. We thought our genetic profile was chiseled in stone and you just had to make the best of what you got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new science of epigenetics is turning all of that on its head. Yes, you might have a gene that predisposes you to cancer or dementia, fibromyalgia, migraines, thyroid deficiency, obesity, arthritis, or some other condition but you have huge control over whether the gene is activated or not. And if you do activate it, there&rsquo;s also a chance it can be turned off &ndash; or at least cooled down. It turns out that our genes are not so much chiselled in stone but written in pencil and they can be erased and rewritten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIGHT SWITCH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Nashim Ashraf of the DNA Center for Integrative Medicine and Wellness in Abu Dhabi says, &ldquo;Genes are like a light switch, that&rsquo;s how people should think.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Epigenetics is the new science of medicine that modifies the expression&nbsp;of the gene.&rdquo; This work is the specialty&nbsp;of the DNA Health Center&rsquo;s team of US-trained and US-certified professional medical and naturopathic specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So you have the genes you were born with, I can&rsquo;t change those but what I can do with diet, supplements, hormone replacements, and other treatments, is either turn off the gene or turn on the gene, like a light switch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Basically, people think genes are your destiny but that&rsquo;s not quite true,&rdquo; Dr Ashraf says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your genes hold the gun but your lifestyle and environment pull the trigger. Meaning you can modify your genetic makeup to prevent diseases from developing that you thought you were destined to have &ndash; that is epigenetics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists now know that our genes are in constant dialogue with our environment. Our genes respond to stress, diet, activity levels, and other environmental changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you have the genes you were born with, I can&rsquo;t change those but what I can do with diet, supplements, hormone replacements, and other treatments, is either turn off the gene or turn on the gene, like a light switch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does this all mean? Especially in a world now groaning under the weight of a pandemic of lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, auto-immune diseases, digestive issues, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What it means is how you feed&nbsp;and move your body; how you deal with stress and negative emotions, and what toxins such as radiation, BPAs and pollution you are exposed to, have much more impact on the diseases&nbsp;you will or won&rsquo;t get than your genetic profile. Biology is not destiny; you create your own future with every bite, breath, thought, step, puff, reaction, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s never too soon to get yourself tested through a healthy wellness check, says Dr Ashraf. &ldquo;The first thing we&nbsp;try to impress is do not wait till your&nbsp;60 years old for that. It&rsquo;s too late! You should have a healthy wellness check from the age of 30. The human body starts deteriorating from the age of 25; your hormones start decreasing&hellip; that&rsquo;s when you should be tested. For people with a high incidence of disease in the family, they should come earlier.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JOLIE MASTECTOMY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most famous cases of using Predictive Genetic Testing (PGT) to make decisions about future disease&nbsp;risk has been Angelina Jolie. The Hollywood movie star got herself tested for the genes that predispose someone to breast cancer. Jolie&nbsp;got tested because breast cancer is prevalent in her family. Unfortunately, she did have the breast cancer&nbsp;genes and the wisdom of traditional medicine was that she was a ticking time bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The genetic test is for BRCA-1 and BRCA-2,&rdquo; Dr Ashraf says. &ldquo;If you have these two genes you have a 90 per cent chance of developing breast cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For 80 per cent of people, the most common time in which cancer comes is the fourth and fifth decade of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Due to Jolie&rsquo;s age at the time, it&nbsp;was almost certain she would develop the disease in five to seven years so she decided, rightfully so I believe, that she would have a bilateral mastectomy. That&rsquo;s epigenetics. So yes in this case surgery had to be done, which is extreme but in future that will change because we are working out how to silence these genes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While medical science has figured out how to turn some genes off, it has not so far figured out the BRCA genes. But hopefully, says Dr Ashraf, Jolie&rsquo;s daughter or granddaughter will not have to resort to surgery as in time we will discover the keys to turning off these genes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SIMPLE CURES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you turn off genes related to disease? Through herbs, exercise, anti- inflammatory foods, anti-oxidants, stress management, detoxing, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incredibly, one of the most effective ways to turn off genes that predispose us to disease is the humble spice turmeric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most potent anti- inflammatory effects known to man, the yellow spice turmeric is extremely effective in &lsquo;cooling down&rsquo; these inflamed or triggered genes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dr Ashraf, the challenge though lies in getting enough turmeric to be effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Increase it in your diet, yes, but&nbsp;if I have a patient in whom I want to use turmeric as a medicine, then I give them a turmeric capsule, which is available in any good organic health food store. I take it myself every morning, 1 gram. A friend of mine in Seattle drinks it in a smoothie every morning. This is the science under epigenetics, it is nutrigenomics &ndash; nutrition and genetics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOXIC TRIGGERS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research into what turns the genes off is ongoing but alongside that and possibly more important is figuring out what turns the dormant gene &lsquo;on&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the global epidemics of cancer, obesity, diabetes, heart disease and so on, there&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;re doing as&nbsp;a human race that is turning on these genes, what is it? No surprises for guessing that according to experts like&nbsp;Dr Ashraf, it&rsquo;s sugar, processed foods, pesticides, cigarettes, etc. The diet&nbsp;and lifestyle of the developed world is triggering these dormant mutated genes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re eating genetically modified foods &ndash; tomatoes are being crossed with fish &ndash; can you imagine a fish gene going into a tomato!? We&rsquo;re bombarded with environmental toxins like pesticides and radiation from computers, cellphones, microwaves&hellip; these are all examples of the increased and changing landscape of toxins and environmental hazards that we are being exposed to that, even just 50 years ago, people were not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest killer today is metabolic syndrome, which means obesity, high fat, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. I believe this is triggered by the sugar in our diet, by our sedentary lifestyles, fast foods and too many carbs,&rdquo; Dr Ashraf says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE GENE TESTING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those concerned about future illnesses or conditions that might be written in their DNA, the DNA Center for Integrative Medicine and Wellness offers evaluation and treatment by a US-trained multi-disciplinary medical team that covers all corners of health and wellbeing. Services include, a personalised blueprint for health assessment; a Full Body Imaging CT Scan/early detection screening for cancer and cardiovascular risk; comprehensive functional genetic and metabolic&nbsp;testing; bio-impedance analysis; heart, lung and tissue analysis; testing for food sensitivities, as well as a holistic treatment plan that offers everything from traditional and alternative medicine, to aesthetic procedures, and yoga and spiritual therapies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If someone comes to us and says, &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t lose weight&hellip;&rdquo; we approach them here at DNA not by saying &lsquo;ok, how many calories will you burn,&nbsp;what is the latest fad diet&hellip;&rsquo; no, you have to start with genetic profiling of that individual. There is a gene called FTO, Fat Associated Obesity gene, if you have this, you have a 50 per cent&nbsp;chance of being obese. Or you may have increased appetite because of a problem with your hormone leptin; you may have an issue with insulin resistance; you may have an issue with breaking down fat or enhanced absorption of&nbsp;fat, and so on. So the first thing we do at DNA is look at the individual and their complete basic genetic makeup specific to their condition. Someone comes in for migraines, 80 per cent of that can be prevented or improved by removing food allergies. We are seeing children here with autism and hyperactivity disorders, women with severe hormonal issues and none of them realise it&rsquo;s all triggered by food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once we have the results,&nbsp;the patient meets with our multi- disciplinary team, we have a US- trained doctors, integrative medicine specialists, a naturopath, homeopath, Ayurvedic specialists, Yoga teacher, exercise specialists, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Ashraf says that the whole concept of holistic integrated healthcare is that having a genetic mutation doesn&rsquo;t mean that in most cases that you will actually have the disease, but it makes you at more risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are talking about the most common chronic conditions, like heart disease, chronic pain, migraine, cancer, thyroid&hellip; a multitude of conditions that make us age fast and die sooner. So instead of calling it anti-aging, I think the proper term is healthy aging &ndash; there is no such thing as anti-aging, I don&rsquo;t like that term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We do a panel to check you&nbsp;for being susceptible to things like fibromyalgia, or chronic headaches<br />\r\nor pain. We all say, &lsquo;why do I get it&rsquo;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s because you may have that gene&nbsp;so you have to super bombard that patient with the right antioxidants and supplements and you have to detoxify them&hellip; you have to remove the toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called predictive medicine, it&rsquo;s the new frontier of medicine and it&rsquo;s what we do here at the DNA Center.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DNA GENETIC PROFILING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Intrigued?

(24, 'Fertility Therapy with Hypnotherapy', 'body', 'beauty', '', '', '', '<p><em>The desire to have a baby can be so strong that a woman feels it like a physical pain but when there&rsquo;s no obvious reason for infertility, what can be done?&nbsp;</em><strong>Marica Josefina Atta</strong><em>&nbsp;believes hypnotherapy can provide solutions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to conceive when a baby is wanted so badly can leave many women devastated, wondering&nbsp;what&rsquo;s wrong with them.&nbsp;For some women getting pregnant&nbsp;becomes an obsession, something that preys on her mind 24/7. For other women it&rsquo;s a constant sadness and the sight of a baby or a pregnant woman can feel like a punch in the stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of how we react, failure to conceive rarely leaves us untouched and I believe it affects women at the very deepest level of their being. Unfortunately, fertility issues are on the rise and for modern women, it has become one of the major health and wellbeing issues of today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INCONCEIVABLE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a physical reason with either the father or the mother that is behind an inability to conceive but in 25 per cent of all cases there&rsquo;s no obvious explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, whether there is a clear reason or not, what we do know is that our bodies always follow the mind. Every couple is unique; each person carries a history that has formed who they are today, this includes the life&nbsp;and mindset of ancestors, parents, childhood and lifestyle etc. We are largely a result of our past and what we choose to think, feel and do today will form who we become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every suggestion, thought or emotion that we entertain, has a corresponding physiological and chemical response within the body. Emotions gets transformed&nbsp;in the brain into biochemical&nbsp;and electrical messages, that are continuously released directly to the bloodstream and then transmitted to the hypothalamic/pituitary/ gonodal axis &ndash; which are responsible for reproduction. It makes sense therefore to pay attention to our thoughts and emotions when we&rsquo;re planning to conceive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FERTILE MINDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With HypnoBirthing Fertility&nbsp;Therapy, we&rsquo;re focused on fertility,&nbsp;not infertility, since our view is that<br />\r\nno woman or man is flawed, even&nbsp;in cases where a physical reason for&nbsp;no conception is detected. Just think<br />\r\nof the word &lsquo;fertility&rsquo; and see how&nbsp;it makes you feel, then repeat the&nbsp;word &lsquo;infertility&rsquo; and see how that makes you feel. We are all created to&nbsp;be fertile but since our bodies are a result of our mind and lifestyle, we&nbsp;can unconsciously block conception. As a therapist, I begin by looking at&nbsp;the mental and emotional level, where the root cause can be found through hypnosis tools to identify blocks or hindrances for a successful conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering a hypnotic state is just like daydreaming, it&rsquo;s a super-relaxed, altered state of awareness that allows us to access our subconscious mind in order to unblock and release emotions and old patterns as well as to connect with and influence certain parts of our bodies. In the fertility work, we also look at lifestyle and the physical health of the couple. We use a holistic approach so that the whole being becomes balanced allowing&nbsp;an overall improvement in life&nbsp;and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BABY MAKING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of how magically a hypnosis session can work is a client who came to see me to get help with anxiety. She and her husband had tried to conceive for more than a year&nbsp;without success. They had tried some medically assisted technology for conception but with no luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the two sessions I worked with her, we didn&rsquo;t focus on fertility instead we focused on releasing tensions from her mind and body. She could hardly breathe when she first came to me, with a very stiff stomach, which means she didn&rsquo;t even receive her own breath. The more we started to unblock the deeper emotions she could breath deeply again and her body relaxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months later, she rang me to tell me she was six months pregnant and that she knew it was thanks to<br />\r\nour sessions. Of course every case&nbsp;is individual but sometimes our&nbsp;bodies respond quickly with just a few changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STRESS BOMB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s my job to detect what to unblock&nbsp;in couples experiencing infertility so that their bodies will allow conception. Thereby, there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;one-size fits-all&rsquo; solution when working with fertility but we do know that stress in all its forms, has a significant impact on fertility and this is a common element in the lives of modern women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too much stress plays havoc&nbsp;with our hormones, as well as our sleep, wellbeing, relationships, libido, immune system and digestion &ndash; all playing a crucial role in conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see a general state of inflammation in the bodies of people who are under constant stress for a long period of time. Stress manifests differently for everyone, so the individual seeking help should always be met with a customized approach. Stress doesn&rsquo;t only mean a hectic&nbsp;lifestyle, it can also be the result&nbsp;of emotional turbulence; a never- ending striving to perform, or never experiencing peace of mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandra Berga, MD, chair of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University in Atlanta has reported several studies with findings that seemingly healthy women with fertility trouble tend to have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood. Emotional stress also reduces sperm counts in men. A study of 500 men published&nbsp;in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that sperm count dropped when&nbsp;a man&rsquo;s partner was going through In Vitro Fertilization, which is a difficult and anxiety-producing procedure. Another study published in the Journal of Reproduction and Infant Psychology found that couples were less likely&nbsp;to achieve pregnancy if the man was depressed and had low self-esteem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEMININE SUPPRESSION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue for women that I see every day in my job as a hypnotherapist and Theta healer is the suppression of naturally feminine traits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every human being is born with&nbsp;a mix of feminine and masculine&nbsp;energy. Feminine would be described<br />\r\nas the nurturing, open, sensitive, receiving part of us. Masculine is the directed, action-orientated, giving<br />\r\npart of us. Everyone&rsquo;s combination of these energies is individual but in the business/success orientated society that we have today, typically female traits&nbsp;are often considered weaknesses while masculine traits are strengths. Daily, women come to me for therapy who&nbsp;are subconsciously suppressing their feminine in order to fit into society, compete in the workplace, please family, etc. How is this related to conception? Conception is about receiving, which&nbsp;is a feminine trait. To receive a man,&nbsp;to receive love, to receive a life in your womb, to receive a baby into your&nbsp;life. Many of us are so accustomed to performing, giving and achieving that receiving make us feel guilty or uneasy. Suppression is always perceived as stress for our mind, whatever it is that we&rsquo;re suppressing. Since conception happens between two people, the state of the man, &lsquo;the giver&rsquo; in the case of conception, needs to be considered as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HYPNO FERTILITY THERAPY FAQ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. What is Hypnotherapy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering a hypnotic state is just like daydreaming, it&rsquo;s a super-relaxed, altered state of awareness that allows us to access our subconscious mind in order to unblock and release unhelpful emotions and old patterns as well as to connect with and influence certain parts of our bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. How does HypnoBirthing Fertility Therapy work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It typically takes four to six sessions but this can vary. It can be an effective aid and support for conception by itself or it can be used alongside In Vitro Fertilization and other Assisted Reproduction Technologies for a greater chance of success. The sessions are a combination of working with deep relaxation techniques, hypnotherapy, health care advising, breathing practice and conscious counseling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.hypnobirthingdubai.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>MARICA JOSEFINA ATTA is a certified Clinical HypnoTherapist, Theta Healer, HypnoBirthing pratictioner and Fertility Consultant.

(25, 'Healing power of Chinese Energetics', 'body', 'body', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em>An ancient energy healing technique known as Chinese Energetics views humans as bio-computers that can be healed by accessing the nervous system to clear energetic blocks. Words by Tamara Pitelen.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Energetics is an energy healing technique developed over thousands of years in&nbsp;the ancient Shaolin Temple in China. However, it&rsquo;s only in the last 20 years that the Buddhist monks of Shaolin brought this knowledge to the rest of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, Chinese Energetics addresses energetic trauma, beliefs and emotions stored in the nervous system so that physical and mental pain is eliminated and life goals can be realised. It&rsquo;s a technique for finding the root cause of any life issue and to remove the sabotages that hold us back in life, thus optimising all aspects of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premise of Chinese Energetics is that humans are multi-faceted&nbsp;beings with six levels of consciousness, namely physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, psychic, and psychological. The technique works to bring all levels of consciousness into balance. It does this through a combination of anatomy, physiology, structural analysis, energetic technique, quantum physics and Qi and Shen Gong Training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPIRIT MEETS BODY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yazan Rahman is a UAE-based Chinese Energetics practitioner. He says the modality works at the &ldquo;foundation of where the spirit meets the human body&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a life transformation expert at an energetic level. My focus is on life- changing shifts, changing deep rooted patterns, beliefs and transmuting them into a joyful, flowing, happy and fulfilled person.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not only working on human beings, we&rsquo;re also working&nbsp;on situations, on relationships,<br />\r\non energies in the matrix relating&nbsp;to karma, ancestral limitations&hellip; basically I work to realign the energetic matrix. Suddenly things get resolved, in the end it&rsquo;s all energy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Energetics views human beings as bio computers. The human brain and the central nervous system&nbsp;work together like a computer system and the belief is that pain arises when accumulation of too many unneeded programs slows down our computer system and causes energy congestion. Pain is just a sign that something is wrong with the flow of energy in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have what we call the leading life supports,&rdquo; Yazan says. &ldquo;Almost everything will fall into one of six categories, namely health, finances, fitness, relationships, career and life purpose, and time/less ageing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Yazan, all of these six leading life supports are affected on the physical, mental, emotional, psychic, psychological and spiritual levels. And they&rsquo;re all interconnected into these levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So if you ask me, &lsquo;what do you treat in 70 per cent of the cases that come to you?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you it&rsquo;s issues related to the psychic body, which some people call the etheric body or the energy field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In Chinese Energetics they&rsquo;ve identified this as a body or a sphere&nbsp;of consciousness and through our human history, the psychic body has been completely invaded through tribal norms, ancestral norms, societal norms and rules, family and church programming, and so on. The psychic body is very thin yet it&rsquo;s extremely powerful. Through the generations, people have become unaware of its existence but it&rsquo;s like the hole in the ozone layer, it affects everything else including our mental, emotional and physical states. Yet entire societies&nbsp;are set up without the psychic body being identified so with a client we&nbsp;first have to bring awareness of their psychic body. Often the psychic body is completely permeable so we have to strengthen it, make it impermeable and treat the issue in it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOMMY DEAREST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as the kind of success stories Yazan has had with clients, he gives the example of a woman in Dubai who has her own fitness centre for women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s brilliant and very creative, an entrepreneur but she was having a difficult time managing her all female team of staff. She thought it was because she was just being too nice to them but that was not the case. When I looked into it, I saw that she had been psychically invaded by her mother while growing up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, her mum was verbally&nbsp;abusive, that&rsquo;s what we would say&nbsp;in psychology, but that&rsquo;s just on the surface. So although she hasn&rsquo;t spoken to her mother in years, she was walking around with that psychic imprint in her psychic body. That had to be cleansed. Once that&rsquo;s cleansed, it&rsquo;s healed for her and for her mum. It&rsquo;s not only healed for the two of them because, remember, we&rsquo;re multi-dimensional beings. You don&rsquo;t know how many others in the soul family are involved, or if she goes on to have a daughter. So it&rsquo;s a massive release and she felt an immediate shift in how her team related to her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SUBCONSCIOUS CLUES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a new client comes to Yazan for help with a problem in their life, the first thing he does is ask them to write him an email bullet-pointing&nbsp;the issues. From this, he analyses the language to find the areas of weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The key is the language, it provides clues to the subconscious but even if someone doesn&rsquo;t speak we can still work on them with intuition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;From there, the process is that, intuitively, I find out which are the three weakest out of the six leading life supports. I would keep that to myself initially because they might not be what the client thinks they are. For me, the leading weakness energetically might appear to career and life purpose but the client is coming to&nbsp;me because of emotional problems with her mum. Often the root of your problem is not what you think it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The weakest words energetically are what we begin working on and as we do we make energetic corrections in the brain, subconscious and the spine. I do that with my intention. For this, I merge Chinese Energetics, Angelic Healing, and Shamanism.&nbsp;I work with three powerful angels who I bring into the healing. I also use vibrational frequency to dissolve heavy energy. That is all guided; I don&rsquo;t decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To book an appointment with Yazan, email: yazanpower1@gmail.com. For more information, go to his website at www.yazanpower.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHINESE ENERGETICS TRIED AND TESTED</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tamara Pitelen goes guinea pig when she sits down with Yazan for a Chinese Energetics healing session.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I told Yazan that I wanted to work on making my business more profitable and bring my financial struggles to an end. In addition, I wanted to stop struggling to lose weight (there&rsquo;s that word again &ndash; &lsquo;struggle&rsquo;) and I wanted some clarity on certain health issues, eg, why I have such an abnormally low blood pressure and metabolic rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yazan immediately picked up the word &lsquo;struggle&rsquo;. This is what he said:&nbsp;&ldquo;So &lsquo;struggling&rsquo; is the weakest word from everything you&rsquo;ve said. This is coming from your family, your father&rsquo;s ancestors. This is from your ancestors&rsquo; karma of making others struggle and slog, so business owners and landowners, indentured servitude, slavery&hellip; so we&rsquo;re going to resolve that for you, for your ancestors, and all the people on the receiving end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strengthen you to delete all experiences of struggling in this life, past lives, all lives and all the effects its had on you&hellip; lets resolve the karma between you and your dad and his karma with you and his family, with him and his mum. Let&rsquo;s release the excess mental energy and control, his wanting to control the outcome and the money, having enough money, not having enough money, all the beliefs you&rsquo;ve inherited from your family, from your father. He&rsquo;s coming in very strongly around the issue of money so let&rsquo;s resolve his karma with money, all the people he owes money, and the psychic energy that may have seeped to you, your siblings, your mother and your family, around what is owed, debts, karmic debts, not necessarily money. Let&rsquo;s resolve that, let&rsquo;s ask Archangel Michael to unplug you and uncord you from your dad, first in the mind area, that&rsquo;s an unhooking, let&rsquo;s resolve this for the whole family, give a command to release and let go, forgive and forget&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was just the start of it. I was impressed that Yazan immediately intuited that&nbsp;my issues stemmed from a father figure &ndash; it turned out to be my stepfather, not my birth father, with whom the problems lay. No surprise to me. That was revealed later on in the session that all up took about an hour. The session also included some sound healing and I felt like I was being held in a bubble of something lovely. The other thing was that at one point, Yazan asked that people, information, situations flow into my life that could help me find answers to my questions. A few weeks later, I was at a conference where&nbsp;I happened to meet a doctor who specialises in thyroid conditions. He took one look at me and said, &lsquo;Sit down, I&rsquo;m going to tell you what&rsquo;s wrong with you&hellip;&rsquo; To cut a long story short, he told me I had mild hypothyroidism the result of being born with a defective thyroid gene. Subsequent tests proved him right and so at last I have some answers as to why I&rsquo;ve been dogged by certain health and mental issues for most of my life that nothing seemed to fix. Coincidence? I don&rsquo;t know. As for my business cash flow, I can&rsquo;t say the money is tumbling in yet but it&rsquo;s improved slightly.

Today, the two resorts are Barberyn Beach Resort and Barberyn Reef Resort. Together, they employ eight doctors and 52 therapists, comprising Ayurvedic physicians, therapists, dieticians and pharmacists, who treat patients with health issues&nbsp;of every kind including blood-related problems, arthritis, rheumatism, obesity and mental stress. But you don&rsquo;t need to have something wrong you to take time out at Baberyn, guests with no specific complaints also benefit from detoxing, de- stressing, and strengthening the immune system to improve general wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOOD AS MEDICINE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my stay, I chose the Barberyn Reef Resort, located right on Beruwala Beach. I spent my week in a simple room with private terrace facing the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On arrival, I was in need of rest and recovery. My first day began with an in-depth consultation with one of the resident Ayurvedic doctors and from this my dietary and treatment programme&nbsp;is set. I was asked questions like, &ldquo;What is your favorite season?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is your digestion?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you get angry easily?&rdquo; The answers gave my doctor a clear picture of my dominating &lsquo;dosha&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of Ayurvedic medicine is that health exists when there is a balance between three fundamental bodily energies or &lsquo;doshas&rsquo; called vata, pitta and kapha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ayurveda, food is complementary medicine and for me, no coffee, no wheat, no dairy and no meat are prescribed. I&rsquo;m also advised not to eat much cold food, and am served plenty of&nbsp;papaya juice and a tasty green soup with my meals. I indulge in all the delicious curry foods, red rice dishes and salads, and don&rsquo;t feel hungry or deprived for a moment. Life is good at Barberyn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MASSAGE AND OIL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My treatment programme includes a daily Ayurvedic massage and herbal body packs to eliminate cellulite and some small skin allergies. I also take herbal medicine twice daily. Everything is prepared for me with great care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight of my week is the shirodara treatment where medicated oil is poured over my third eye for 40 minutes. It is a deeply relaxing treatment that balances the hormonal system and cures issues like insomnia and tinnitus. I go into a dream state and wake up feeling wonderful. It&nbsp;is no surprise that over 80 per cent of Barberyn&rsquo;s guests are returning customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING HOLIDAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barberyn resort is not a typical luxury resort but offers a tailor-made healing programme for body and mind. Other facilities include a swimming pool, dining room and relaxing areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resort has a peaceful and family oriented atmosphere. Your programme&nbsp;is complemented by optional activities such as yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, lectures on Ayurveda, cooking demonstrations, traditional live music at dinner, boat tours, a library with literature on culture and spirituality, as well as inspirational movies and videos.

Our skin is the largest organ in our bodies and it&rsquo;s extremely permeable. It eliminates body waste and is our largest immune defense barrier, when we put toxic ingredients on our body, up to 60 per cent is absorbed into our blood stream. This is particularly important for leave-on cosmetic products like hair dyes, facial creams and make-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even using a small amount of a toxic chemical everyday over the longer term will accumulate in the tissues and organs of our body. This chemical pollution is called Body Burden and recent scientific studies show that these chemicals are toxic even&nbsp;at very low doses. Some of these chemicals may be the culprits of rapidly rising rates of infertility. If you are pregnant or breast- feeding, you&rsquo;re exposing your baby to these chemicals, which can detrimentally affect their development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why choosing organic products with ingredients derived from living matter such as plants, vegetables and fruit is safer for you and the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organic products use ingredients grown without the use of pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers, chemicals, or carcinogens.

The cycle can be stressful and upsetting for sufferers &ndash; as well as for the parents of a child plagued with ezcema but there is a way out, writes&nbsp;<strong>Delphinia Tam-Lower</strong>&nbsp;of Four Cow Farm.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afew years ago in Queensland, Australia, there was a grandmother who wanted&nbsp;to make skin creams and balms for&nbsp;her grandchildren, one of whom had eczema. Also a midwife, she wanted to use time-tested and traditional recipes. From these small beginnings grew a business called Four Cow Farm. That ingenious grandmother is my mother- in-law and now our whole family is involved with producing a range of handcrafted, 100 per cent natural and organic skincare. Along the way, we&rsquo;ve become experts in the causes and cures of eczema and we&rsquo;ve devised this three-step guide to understanding and living with eczema whether you&rsquo;re age 0 or 90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Understand what&rsquo;s happening under the skin of someone with eczema.<br />\r\nThe word &lsquo;eczema&rsquo; actually covers a very wide range of symptoms and conditions and many types of eczema exist. So, the best first step to take is to try and identify the type of eczema you or your child has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two broad groups of eczema &ndash; eczema that is triggered by direct skin contact with an irritant; and eczema that is caused by an increased sensitivity in the way a person&rsquo;s immune system reacts with their environment. The latter is known as atopic eczema and is the fastest growing type of eczema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A genetic twist of fate means that those with atopic eczema have skin that is unable to retain its own moisture (making&nbsp;it particularly prone to extreme dryness and itch) as well as particularly over-active immune systems that react to a variety of external influences (including the bacteria and yeast that live on all our skins).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: Discover the key triggers (not as easy as you might think!) The next step is to begin whittling down the potential triggers of the symptoms&nbsp;&ndash; and there may be a few! An easy place to start is with the 3 &lsquo;E&rsquo;s of eczema:<br />\r\n(a) Edible &ndash; the most common trigger&nbsp;foods are cow&rsquo;s milk, eggs, soya,&nbsp;wheat, fish and nuts.<br />\r\n(b) Environmental &ndash; the most common&nbsp;culprits are clothing, harsh soaps and detergents, perfumes and preservatives in skincare products, fabric softeners,&nbsp;extreme temperatures, humidity, dust&nbsp;mites, pollen and pets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) Emotional &ndash; strong emotions such&nbsp;as stress and anger may trigger a worsening of the symptoms, as well as illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways of identifying&nbsp;triggers is to remove them, one at a time, to see if the eczema improves. Four to six weeks per trigger is best for certainty so patience, patience, patience&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another approach is allergy testing which can be helpful if a specific allergy is suspected, though those with atopic eczema may test positive for none or many of the allergens tested. And all&nbsp;this will do is merely confirm that the form of eczema is atopic eczema (which, as described above, has its basis in the immune system), and not other forms of eczema whose main triggers are external.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wheretheprimarycauseofeczemais an external irritant, identifying the culprit or culprits will see an immediate and marked improvement in one&rsquo;s skin, or the disappearance of the eczema entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With atopic eczema, removing those key triggers will reduce the number of &lsquo;flare-ups&rsquo; which take place, but the dryness and itchiness is likely to continue for a while, and helping one&rsquo;s skin to cope with both on an ongoing basis will be absolutely crucial (we&rsquo;ll tackle this in the next section).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3: Put in place a very disciplined skincare regime (and we mean really disciplined!)<br />\r\nWith atopic eczema, the skin is unable to hold onto its own moisture. This consistent dryness is a primary trigger of itching, which can often lead to flare- ups, so helping the skin retain its own moisture is absolutely key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bath-time is a key time at which to protect the skin from loss of moisture. Sobeextremelycarefuland selective with shampoos, soaps and washes. Avoid products containing harsh synthetic detergents such as sodium lauryl/laureth sulphate or cocamidopropyl betaine and harsh preservatives such as phenoxyethanol or benzyl alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replenishing the skin&rsquo;s moisture is key. And dermatologists all agree that regular, repeated moisturising is crucial&nbsp;to managing eczema. By helping the skin maintain its moisture, we help maintain the health of the skin, and its ability to defend itself against external triggers and allergens. So if there&rsquo;s one mantra everyone needs to repeat when dealing with eczema, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;moisturise, moisturise, moisturise!&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For parents and carers of children with ezcema, help your child moisturise at regular intervals during the day. As you&rsquo;ll beapplyingyourchosenmoisturiservery, very often, make sure it&rsquo;s made from the very best natural ingredients. Skin with eczema is often thinner and more likely to absorb and react to the substances placed on it, so avoid anything containing synthetic nasties, artificial chemicals, added fragrances or petroleum derivatives (see the Four Cow Farm Guide on Baby Skincare for selecting safe skincare under &lsquo;Learn More&rsquo; on the FCF website).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more information, visit www.fourcowfarm.com/blog or email advice@fourcowfarm.com.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOUR COW FARM IN THE UAE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Four Cow Farm range of handcrafted, 100 per cent natural and organic skincare products are available</strong><strong>in Holland and Barrett stores throughout the UAE.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>The range includes Baby Lotion (125ml AED 53), Baby Wash (125ml AED 49), Calendula Remedy (50g AED 70), Tea Tree Remedy (50g AED 62), and more.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not just for babies!

Basma Saimua reports on a new yoga programme for children being introduced into Dubai&rsquo;s schools.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine teaching children skills that will help build their self esteem and self-love. How about teaching them compassion and empathy for others or encouraging them to understand their feelings and to learn how deal with them&nbsp;in a healthy way. This is what yoga does, through mindfulness practices, breathing exercises, and postures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years now, adults have been turning to yoga to help them find balance in their lives and some peace in a world that is constantly on the go. The modern world&nbsp;of constant distractions and hectic lifestyles also affects young people. For children, stresses result from wanting to fit in, peer pressure, exams, competitive sport, and being bombarded with information from social media, television, and the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these times, practicing yoga can also help children find more balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LITTLE YODAS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mahatma Gandhi once said: &ldquo;If we are to reach real peace in this world, we shall have to begin with children.&rdquo; What better way to raise compassionate and emotionally stable adults than to reach them when they are children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through mindfulness practices children learn how to stay in the present moment, helping them learn how to be aware of their emotions in the moment, whether good or bad, and how to deal with these emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through breathing (pranayama) they learn the skill of relaxing their minds and bodies, which brings more peace into their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through postures (asana) they become strong and flexible. As well, it teaches them to remain focused, which is required to stay balanced and develop in their poses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these practices are integrated into their every day lives shaping their experiences and relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to get children into yoga is to introduce it to schools and make it part of the educational system. That is the motivation of the Dubai-based founders of an after-school yoga programme<br />\r\nfor children in Dubai schools. Called Posetivity, the programme is the brainchild of Katherine Cebrowski and Natalia Hassaniyeh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to provide a place and opportunity for every student to realise his or her limitless potential,&rdquo; Cebrowski says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Children are constantly challenged and placed in competitive and multi- sensory environments; whether it&rsquo;s at school, sports team or even at home. This creates constant internal stress for the child. Posetivity provides a non- competitive playground where children are equal and are given the opportunity to explore their own potential.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHILD&rsquo;S POSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women say that their motivation for launching Posetivity came from children themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are our future and the ones who can create change. As adults, we recognise and appreciate the benefits of yoga, meditation and self-awareness so why not start teaching these vital tools to our children earlier in life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our programmes equip children with life skills that will encourage them to face challenges with positivity, open mindedness and confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have customized a Posetivity curriculum that tackles many physical, mental, and emotional challenges&nbsp;that exist in youth. Whether it is our fun yoga sequencing, or engaging mindfulness exercises, we strive to teach techniques and tips that the students learn in the classroom and practice in the real world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE POSETIVITY PROGRAMMES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main Posetivity programmes, aimed at children of different ages. The Mini Vibes programme is for three to five year olds; the Good Vibes programme is for six to 11 year olds, and the Elevate programme is for 12 to 18 year olds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the programmes comprise three elements; yoga postures, mindfulness, and emotional intelligence. So far, 10 Dubai schools have taught the Good Vibes and Elevate programmes while some nurseries around the city are offering the Mini Vibes programme for pre-schoolers. A new programme called Yoga for the Special Child is slated to launch in Dubai soon and all the programmes will also be available in various Dubai yoga studios.

Here she writes about how &lsquo;clean eating saved my life&rsquo;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I moved to Dubai in 2008. I was a carefree 20-something, thinking my fresh-faced glow and fast metabolism would forever be on my side. Partying non-stop with McDonald&rsquo;s on speed dial, I was also &lsquo;that&rsquo; girl who ordered a diet Coke with a burger meal, blindly swapping calories for chemicals. No stranger to the infamous &lsquo;Dubai Stone&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve tried every diet under the desert sun, which, while we&rsquo;re on the subject, I&rsquo;d lie under for hours on end; oiled up in the knowledge that my sun-drenched skin could be fixed with a quick shot of Botox. This was the 21st Century after all, in the fastest-growing city on Earth; there was always a solution. Nothing could beat me, or so I thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But my yo-yo-dieting-week-long-partying choices were damaging my health and within a few years, I was suffering from a long list of health issues, the least of my worries was the Dubai Stone (or two), I also&nbsp;had anxiety issues, skin pigmentation, and insomnia but worst of all was the aspartame poisoning from artificially-sweetened drinks. This resulted in me being rushed to hospital with Optic Neuritis, which left me blind for three months in my left eye. The party was officially over. Doctors said that if my lifestyle didn&rsquo;t change, I would lose my sight forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After researching natural ways to cure myself, I discovered the clean eating craze that was taking the world by storm. Not only did I heal my sight in three weeks but I unintentionally dropped about six kilos, and experienced a series of further mini-miracles, from curing my insomnia and anxiety, to transforming my hair, skin and nails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today, I leap out of bed and no longer need multiple layers of make-up, Botox, or an intravenous drip of caffeine to get me through the day. I exercise for two hours a day and hardly touch alcohol or food that doesn&rsquo;t have a natural source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For the first month, I went cold turkey, giving up meat, caffeine, alcohol, chemicals, processed foods, and anything that wasn&rsquo;t completely natural, whilst choosing&nbsp;organic where possible. Even pharmaceutical products were banned. No chemicals whatsoever were allowed near me. I also stopped having cosmetic treatments, including Botox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As the days, weeks and months progressed,&nbsp;I felt like a snake shedding layers of skin; as a lighter, happier, and more energetic version of myself appeared each morning; standing in front of the mirror a little more radiant each day. Within a very short amount of time, my skin was tighter, firmer, and brighter; and my clothes got looser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once I felt I&rsquo;d flushed all the chemicals out, I began to re-introduce lean meats and a small amount of caffeine if I fancied it but I made a concerted effort to swap all items for healthier alternatives. Apart from processed foods and chemicals, which are still banned because of my health; I&rsquo;m more flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not perfect and I&rsquo;m never going to be. Sometimes, we just need that doughnut, glass of wine, or chocolate bar. The trick for me is to get right back on the healthy vibe the next day, and not to beat myself up about it. This isn&rsquo;t about being perfect, it&rsquo;s about good health, and finding a balance &ndash; whilst giving ourselves the flexibility to be human, and enjoy the finer things, guilt-free!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HANNAH SWANSTON is a full-time writer who divides her time between London and Dubai.

(31, 'The beginnerâ€™s ï¿¼guide to ï¿¼clean eating', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>A new approach to healthy eating and wellness, clean eating is about keeping things as natural and chemical-free as possible&nbsp;&ndash; food that hasn&rsquo;t been made in a factory. The benefits? Weight- loss, disease reversal, hormonal balance, improved memory, happiness&hellip; and more.&nbsp;<strong>Hannah Swanston</strong>&nbsp;explains.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term &lsquo;clean eating&rsquo; is fairly ambiguous but the concept is focused around eating foods in&nbsp;their most natural state whilst avoiding anything processed or laden with chemicals, as well as refined grains and refined sugars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could also call it a &lsquo;low HI diet&rsquo; or &lsquo;low human involvement diet&rsquo; because the best food for your body is as close as possible to its natural, whole form with as little human interference as possible. Eating clean means eating mainly fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, meat, poultry and seafood &ndash; organic is best to ensure you&rsquo;re not filling yourself with pesticides and growth hormones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new approach is about making conscious decisions about what you&rsquo;re putting into your body and taking responsibility for your long-term health. It isn&rsquo;t a diet; it&rsquo;s a lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LOW HUMAN INVOLVEMENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many strict weight-loss diets will drop a few kilos before a big occasion but the reason millions of people are always&nbsp;looking for the next best solution is because each diet has one thing in common; they&rsquo;re quick-fixes with strict and unsustainable guidelines that rarely consider your health so invariably the excess weight returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exciting prospect of clean eating is that once you decide to make health your number one priority, you won&rsquo;t ever need to worry about the risks to your wellbeing, let alone the need to diet ever again. In short, there is no diet that exists today that will do what healthy eating does. Skip the diet. Choose health, and have a balanced life instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLEAN EATING BASICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to try Clean Eating? Here are the basics: The key theme at the heart of the clean eating concept is &lsquo;good health&rsquo; so before you eat, simply ask yourself: &ldquo;Is this food going to nourish my body?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting clean might just mean tweaking what you&rsquo;re doing now,&nbsp;or it may inspire you to turn over a whole new leaf. In either case, here&nbsp;are a few points to keep in mind when considering your new, healthier lifestyle:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Eat foods in their most natural&nbsp;state, or made with natural&nbsp;ingredients,</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid processed foods high in&nbsp;chemical additives, salts, trans fats&nbsp;and refined sugars,</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid artificial ingredients and&nbsp;preservatives including sweeteners</li>\r\n	<li>Keep your alcohol and caffeine&nbsp;intake low and avoid sodas and&nbsp;fruit juices,</li>\r\n	<li>Eat plenty of vegetables. If you&rsquo;re&nbsp;watching your weight, get most of&nbsp;your carbohydrates from vegetables,</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid refined flour; white pastas&nbsp;and white bread,</li>\r\n	<li>Enjoy fruit but moderate your&nbsp;intake due to high sugar content,</li>\r\n	<li>Eat healthy fats like avocado,&nbsp;coconut oil, nuts.</li>\r\n	<li>Drink two to three litres of water a day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that eating fresh fruit and vegetables can aid in the prevention and control of weight<br />\r\ngain. Studies also suggest a diet rich in these healthy food groups can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, stroke and diabetes. Additionally, cutting down&nbsp;on the added salt and sugar is also integral to clean eating. Research shows a reduction of dietary salt intake can help delay or prevent hypertension and decrease the chances of cardiovascular- related health issues and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENJOY THE PROCESS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with, you may think&nbsp;that clean eating seems too much&nbsp;of a drastic change. But it&rsquo;s not<br />\r\nabout transforming your life (and cupboards) overnight; it&rsquo;s about going at the pace that&rsquo;s right for you. Make small changes; try new things; see what you like, and what you don&rsquo;t. Remember, it&rsquo;s not a set plan; it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;healthier lifestyle, and the key to successful clean eating is making healthy decisions most of the time, but giving yourself some flexibility. This isn&rsquo;t about being perfect. Give yourself an 80/20 balance. The 20 per cent gives you leeway to be human so if you really want a cupcake then have one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GOING SHOPPING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time you eat is an opportunity to nourish your body. So where possible choose organic and avoid processed foods, sugars, starchy carbohydrates, trans fats, chemicals, and where possible, have a healthy balance of caffeine and alcohol. When cooking try to bake, steam, grill or eat raw. If you get stuck&nbsp;in the supermarket, use your common sense or read the label: &lsquo;Was this created in a laboratory or in nature? Will this food help to nourish my body?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Fruit and vegetables: All seasonal, but eat more green veggies and lower sugared fruit. (Eating seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables a&nbsp;day reduces your risk of death at any point in time by 42 per cent compared to eating less than one portion, reports a new UCL study.)</li>\r\n	<li>Protein: Free-range eggs, salmon, chicken, shrimp, white fish, tuna, turkey, tofu.</li>\r\n	<li>Healthy fats and oils: Avocado, virgin olive oil, flax and chia seed, all natural, (palm-oil free) peanut or almond butter (no sugar or salt)</li>\r\n	<li>Nuts: Raw almonds and sunflower seeds</li>\r\n	<li>Grains and complex &lsquo;good&rsquo; carbs: Rye or spelt bread, quinoa, millet, brown rice, oatmeal, sweet<br />\r\n	potato, legumes.</li>\r\n	<li>Dairy: Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, almond milk</li>\r\n	<li>Coconut products: water, milk and oil.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>BEAT YOUR SUGAR CRAVINGS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, the less you eat sugary foods, the less you&rsquo;ll crave them. Sugar works&nbsp;like a drug so stop taking it to break the addiction. To take its power away, reach for healthier alternatives. Keep a variety of delicious, healthy snacks in your bag, or at your desk to stop you reaching for naughty treats. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Nuts, seeds, prunes and plain popcorn</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Raspberries, blueberries and&nbsp;chopped apple<br />\r\n&bull; Bell pepper (capsicum) and&nbsp;cucumber sticks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if one of those all-consuming sugar cravings does hit you, don&rsquo;t panic, just try one of my favourite healthy quick-fixes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Eat two to three pieces of organic dark chocolate (over 70 per cent cacao)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Fill a bowl with Greek yoghurt, blueberries and raspberries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Eat a tub of organic frozen yoghurt with prunes and bananas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more tips on preventing sugar cravings in the first place, here&rsquo;s how to change your diet to give yourself the best chance of quelling those cravings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat foods high in chromium:</strong>&nbsp;Broccoli, whole grains, sweet potatoes, apples, and pastured eggs.&nbsp;Chromium regulates cholesterol levels and blood sugar.<br />\r\n<strong>Eat foods high in zinc:</strong>&nbsp;Whole grains, pastured eggs, pumpkin seeds, Brazil nuts and oysters. Zinc from animal sources is absorbed better because it does not contain phytates. Zinc is used for glucose and insulin utilisation.<br />\r\n<strong>Eat foods high in magnesium:</strong>&nbsp;Dark leafy greens, raw cacao, nuts&nbsp;and seeds, brown rice, quinoa, and avocado.<br />\r\n<strong>Extra-virgin coconut oil:</strong>&nbsp;Add coconut oil to soups, dishes, smoothies and stir-fries to help boost metabolism and reduce cravings.<br />\r\n<strong>Eat healthy fats with your meals:</strong>&nbsp;Nuts and seeds, avocados, coconut, extra-virgin olive oil, extra-virgin coconut oil, and natural fats from animal products such as wild salmon and pastured eggs. To provide satiety and keep your blood sugar stable. Sleep for 8 hours per night:<br />\r\nMore if you need it. You can never underestimate the power of a good night&rsquo;s sleep. Furthermore, when tired, we have the tendency to crave sugar, and slip back to old habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HANNAH SWANSTON is a full-time writer who divides her time between London and Dubai.

It came as a big shock because I didn&rsquo;t even know&nbsp;I had any symptoms. I thought my healthy lifestyle was keeping me in top shape and I never dreamt I could get a condition that goes hand in hand with blood sugar problems, insulin resistance and hormonal imbalances. Worse news, countless medical reports tell us it&rsquo;s the leading cause of infertility amongst women and the long-term health risks are endometrial cancer and type 2 diabetes1.

In addition, the symptoms are so wide- ranging that they could indicate any number of other conditions including hypothyroidism and diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The usual symptoms associated with PCOS include: Hormone imbalance; hormonal pattern acne; excess hair on the face/back/chest;&nbsp;thinning hair on head; weight gain; carb and sugar cravings; diabetes-like symptoms; insulin resistance, and missed or abnormal periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BODY WISDOM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In medical circles, PCOS is being called a &lsquo;global epidemic&rsquo; as rates of the condition are soaring amongst young women. Interestingly, they are rising in line with obesity and diabetes rates, which for some people puts PCOS in the &lsquo;lifestyle disease&rsquo; category. Others in the medical profession say the condition is genetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is all very interesting&nbsp;in theory but how was I going to tackle this condition in my life? The usual solution for treating PCOS is medication and lifestyle changes2 but I wanted a more holistic approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional allopathic medicine does not consider the idea that the physical, emotional, spiritual, and psychological aspects of a person are irrevocably intertwined but as a therapist, intuitive healer and supporter of alternative ways, I believe illness is part of our inner guidance system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking deeper into the wisdom of our bodies, the ovaries are part of feminine intelligence, something often forgotten in women&rsquo;s health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through millennia, women have been conditioned to believe that&nbsp;they must control and change many aspects of their bodies. Women have been knocked unconscious by the conflicting demands of our cultures, media and society. This results in the belief that the female body is flawed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we all have choices as well as inner guidance and spiritual help that directs us towards optimal health and fulfillment. Our bodies never lie and through their symptoms they get our attention pretty quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, a holistic approach saw PCOS vanish from my body and never return. A fact that is verified by my doctor. Here is a guide to how I did it:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) YOUR BODY &amp; PCOS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being in tune with your body is the number one tool in your PCOS recovery kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to food and exercise. Honour your body. Don&rsquo;t fill it with junk. Eat low-glycemic-index food and reduce excess body fat &ndash; this&nbsp;is especially important. As UK Nutritional Therapist Patrick Holford explains in his book Balance Your Hormones, reducing body fat increases insulin sensitivity and balances<br />\r\ninsulin secretion, which results in normalisation of blood sugar and reduction in excess androgens. (Consult with your doctor or nutritionist about your specific condition.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suspecting that my hormones could be out of whack because of sugar, I decided to detox my body of sugar once and for all with the help of a gentle seven-day fast. Following my intuition and knowledge gathered from relevant books, I ate to keep my blood sugar levels stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still today, I do not eat sugar and I eat few carbs. If I do, it&rsquo;s organic and complex carbs such as quinoa, buckwheat, wild rice, sweet potatoes, amaranth, millet, and oats. I indulge only on special occasions with food like pasta, bread, biscuits and cake. I also realised I need to exercise more so I bought a bicycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I live in Dubai, while&nbsp;all this was happening, I was visiting family in Europe so I connected to the Earth&rsquo;s healing electromagnetic field by spending a lot of time outdoors. Every day I walked in a nearby forest, which helped restore my body&rsquo;s natural balance. I was also using breathing techniques to breath deeply and consciously because this rids the body of toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) YOUR MIND &amp; PCOS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best-selling spiritual authors Esther Hicks and Abraham state that,&nbsp;&ldquo;a physical condition is just an indicator of a chronic thought.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They state that when we feel sad, our organs, which are filled with receptor sites, receive messages<br />\r\nfrom the brain and so also feel sad. And when we feel happy, our organs respond in kind. We store emotions and stresses in our organs. Over time, our thoughts become embodied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, PCOS turned up just after I got married and I&rsquo;d been adjusting to my new role as wife and potential mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was faced with my learned/ inherited beliefs about what a wife and mother &lsquo;should be&rsquo;. I realised I was carrying old patterns about femininity and the obligations of a woman/wife/ mother. I believe part of my healing was releasing these oppressive and limiting definitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural inheritance has a major effect on how our femininity is perceived. As Christiane Northrup says in her book&nbsp;<em>Women&rsquo;s Bodies, Women&rsquo;s Wisdom</em>, our memories are stored in our bodies. &ldquo;We carry our personal history in the tissues that our consciousness co-creates. On some level, we carry everyone and everything &ndash; the collective &ndash; all there within and around our cells.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, mitochondrial DNA&nbsp;is inherited solely from our mother; therefore we carry our mother and grandmother&rsquo;s emotions in our cells too. Clear old beliefs that no longer serve you with the help of a skillful therapist or through your own dedicated self-care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind, take time out&nbsp;to reflect on your feelings and beliefs about your femininity. Northrup offers this technique in her book, find a quiet place, relax and ask yourself:<br />\r\n1) Where do I feel my femininity&nbsp;is powerless?<br />\r\n2) If a family member walks into the&nbsp;kitchen saying, &ldquo;I am hungry&rdquo; or &ldquo;there&nbsp;is nothing to eat&rdquo; &ndash; what do I feel?<br />\r\n3) What are my emotional needs? Are&nbsp;they being met?<br />\r\n4) What would I like to see happen&nbsp;in my job or my life that would&nbsp;nourish me fully?<br />\r\n5) Do I believe that I have the power&nbsp;to change the conditions of my life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) YOUR SOUL &amp; PCOS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dominator system tells us &lsquo;no pain, no gain&rsquo; but often just the opposite is true. When you connect to your heart and soul, you just want to be happy and at peace. If what you are doing gives you no joy, no pleasure, no sense of purpose, no sense of fulfillment, it is not worth doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The soul responds to inner dreams and to pleasure. Your state of health is the barometer of this. Northrup says: &ldquo;Commit to living your dreams &ndash; one day at a time. This is the process that is required to create vibrant health in our families, our communities, and our planet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To connect to your wisdom, find a quiet place and ask yourself:<br />\r\n1) What would it be like if I reclaimed&nbsp;the wisdom of my body and&nbsp;learned how to trust its messages? 2) What would it be like to stop&nbsp;criticizing my body?<br />\r\n3) How would my life be different if&nbsp;my body was my friend and ally? 4) What would it be like to know, in the deepest part of me, that every&nbsp;part of my anatomy and each process in my female body contain wisdom and power?<br />\r\nPolycystic ovaries don&rsquo;t have to be a&nbsp;lifelong, chronic condition. During my healing time I had absolutely no doubt in the process and not long after my initial diagnosis I went back to have another check up. I was told the PCOS was gone. Many scans since then have confirmed&nbsp;I am clear of it. To become healthy and whole, we need to get in touch with the wisdom of our female body and to follow the desires of our heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOURCES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

(33, 'Why I had my mercury fillings removed', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em>Is it time to get the old-style amalgam fillings out of your head once and for all or is it safer to leave them where they are? Tamara Pitelen looks at both sides of the argument while having her own mercury fillings removed&hellip; which she admits might be unnecessary.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This afternoon my mercury fillings removed.<br />\r\nKnown as amalgam&nbsp;fillings, this material has been used in dentistry to fill cavities caused by tooth decay for more than 150 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds of millions of people have these little metal nuggets nestled in their teeth. What&rsquo;s the problem with that? It depends on who you&nbsp;ask but the main issue of contention is that, along with a combination<br />\r\nof silver, tin, and copper, amalgam comprises 50 per cent mercury, which is a highly poisonous substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAME OR TOXIC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not amalgam fillings are bullets of toxic evilness or a harmless and effective method of fixing cavities is one of the hottest topics in dentistry today. The two sides of the argument are at loggerheads. The huge chasm between the viewpoints is nicely illustrated by these two quotes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Amalgam is a primitive, polluting, 19th century product that began&nbsp;when physicians were sawing off legs. Medicine has since moved forward.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the words of Charlie Brown, President of the World Alliance for Mercury-Free Dentistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alternative viewpoint is encapsulated by the American Dental Association (ADA) in this quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Used by dentists for more than&nbsp;a century, dental amalgam is the most thoroughly researched and tested restorative material among all those in use. It is durable, easy to use, highly resistant to wear and relatively inexpensive in comparison to<br />\r\nother materials.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amalgam fillings are now no longer used because of the toxicity and the publicity around it. The<br />\r\nnew material is a composite resin&nbsp;&ndash; interestingly, it&rsquo;s the very same material used to make Formula One cars. Resin is also toxic but it&rsquo;s just not as toxic as mercury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anecdotally, mercury fillings have been blamed for everything from headaches to depression however,<br />\r\nsome dentists say there is no scientific evidence that amalgam fillings are detrimental to health and the resin substitutes have not been tested over time. They argue that we&rsquo;ve had these amalgams in our mouths for more than 100 years but the resin fillings are an unknown quantity over the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amalgam is most dangerous in&nbsp;the first two hours after the filling is placed. That&rsaquo;s you must not eat for several hours after having an amalgam filling. After that, the metal is set, stable and inert and many dentists say that amalgam is far superior to the white resin composites; that the resin will never last as long as the amalgam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAIN AND EXPENSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why am I bothering with all the pain and expense of having my four amalgam fillings removed? Especially when they&rsquo;ve not given me a minute&rsquo;s bother since being put in about 30 or so years ago. As far as I can tell they&rsquo;ve&nbsp;done their job admirably but I&rsquo;m having them removed and replaced with resin composite fillings because a natural health therapist told me I was basically crazy to leave these lumps of toxic metal in my mouth for another minute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derin Bepo, a London-based natural health consultant, is of the opinion that mercury fillings are responsible health challenges that include neurological&nbsp;issues, autoimmune diseases, chronic illnesses and mental disorders. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy not to get those removed immediately!&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He and other amalgam critics say mercury is a potent neurotoxin that damages your brain, central nervous system and kidneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MERCURY, ILLEGAL GOLD AND RACISM<br />\r\nAccording to Charlie Brown of the Campaign for Mercury Free Dentistry: &ldquo;Mercury fillings continue to emit toxic mercury vapour which invades our brains and kidneys.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown is a passionate advocator&nbsp;for mercury-free dentistry. At his website, www.toxicteeth.org, he manages to turn amalgam fillings into a race, class and environmental issue. While some of his accusations sound&nbsp;a bit hysterical, he also says amalgam pollutes water via dental clinic releases and human waste; air via cremation, dental clinic emissions, sludge incineration, and respiration; and land via landfills, burials, and fertiliser. Even the World Health Organization reports that mercury from amalgam and laboratory devices accounts for 53 per cent of total mercury emissions into our environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VIEW FROM A&nbsp;HIGHER POWER<br />\r\nToday, no-one is getting new amalgam fillings but what about with the millions of amalgam fillings already sitting in the mouths of people across the planet? Is it more harmful to remove them than it is to leave them where they are?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I decided I wanted to get a spiritual perspective on the whole subject so&nbsp;off I went to talk to Vanya Silverten, a UK-based Intuitive Healer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silverten tunes into Creator, God, the Universe, the Field, the Source of All That Is&hellip; call this Higher Intelligence what you will but basically she receives information from it. So I asked her, what does the Intelligence of the Universe think about mercury fillings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting because Creator is quite neutral about the whole thing. He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just part of human dentistry&rsquo;. The mercury source isn&rsquo;t great but it&rsquo;s just a historical thing, that&rsquo;s all they had available and now they&rsquo;re moving into other products.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes but is having these fillings in your mouth detrimental to health? Is the anti-amalgam brigade right about the dangers of leeching mercury?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The thing is that some people&rsquo;s leech and some people&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t so it&rsquo;s very individual to each person. Some people do have mercury leeching, it could be because of the food they eat, the way they grind their teeth, the structure of their mouth, or drinking too many hot liquids. So yes, some people do get mercury poisoning from the mercury fillings but other people have no issues at all with them. It is very much on an individual basis so there&rsquo;s no real for or against.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Creator would rather we stopped eating sugar or looked after our teeth better; mercury and tooth fillings are not a solution. They are a problem to solve a problem and Creator is more original solution-based. Don&rsquo;t get the cavity in the first place, change our&nbsp;diets, change the way we brush, there&rsquo;s a lot of things we have to look at in how we care for our bodies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is good advice but the human race is now riddled with amalgam fillings, should we have them removed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That depends, says Silverten. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re small and don&rsquo;t touch the root then they&rsquo;re not too bad. It&rsquo;s the bigger ones that are a problem because what tends to happen is that gums recede, teeth erode, and that&rsquo;s where you get more of the issues, so it really depends on the size of the mercury filling and how far it goes down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also not good to have so much metal in the mouth. If you have one or two, it&rsquo;s ok but if you have a whole mouthful of this stuff it creates problems. It will create more tension in the body because it gets in the way of the body&rsquo;s energy circuits, that can create tension in the jaw, headaches, and that sort of thing because the amalgam is not a conductor so it can scramble the body&rsquo;s own natural energy rhythms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as worst-case scenario conditions caused by leeching mercury fillings, Silverten says these include depression, thyroid issues, lymphatic poisoning, mental illnesses and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;And blocking the heart chakra. It can block the heart from opening up to love, that&rsquo;s what heavy metals can do. They stop the body from receiving more love, but it&rsquo;s not in all people, he&rsquo;s more pointing to larger fillings and mouths full of fillings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MERCURY RETROGRADE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is the actual procedure like? For me it was painless and over in minutes. My dentist, Jelena Pavesic&nbsp;of Dr Joy Dental Clinic in Dubai, did a great job. I was extremely anxious and almost changed my mind. I knew there would be needles involved. It&rsquo;s been years since I had injections in my gums and everything about them sounds bad and painful. Then there was the digging out of the old fillings&nbsp;&ndash; surely that was going to hurt? Hand on heart, it did not hurt at all. Yes, it&rsquo;s a bit uncomfortable having someone&rsquo;s fingers and several metal tools in&nbsp;your mouth at once but that&rsquo;s all it was; uncomfortable. I barely felt the injections and it was over very quickly. I went in at 5pm, I was on my way&nbsp;out at 5.25pm minus two of the four amalgam fillings. The other two are being done at a second appointment, the reason being that dentists don&rsquo;t want to numb both the upper and lower jaw on the same side of the mouth in case of accidental cheek or tongue biting. The anesthetic from three injections into my lower jaw took about five hours to wear off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do I feel now? No different to be honest. I&rsquo;m not sure my mercury fillings were causing me any health problems but one thing that is a huge improvement is the aesthetics; now when I laugh or open my mouth, my teeth are all white instead of showing unsightly lumps of silver metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tamara Pitelen had her amalgam fillings removed by Dr. Jelena Pavesic of Dr Joy Dental Clinic, Villa 1021, Al Wasl Road, Umm Suqeim 2, Dubai.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tel. +971 (0)4 328 5332.</em><br />\r\n<em>Email: enquiry@drjoydentalclinic.com. www.drjoydentalclinic.com</em></p>\r\n', 'holding-photo-of-smile-over-face_web-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-27 06:03:31'),

It drives me nuts when I see obese parents feeding their obese kids pop. This is essentially robbing them of a couple of years of their childhood because the pop cans (BPA) are related directly to premature puberty. And it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and roses for adults either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3 Good Reasons Not To Drink It</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Many of my clients try to justify it by saying that they&rsquo;re eating lots of fruits and vegetables. Well check this out. Pop is an anti-nutrient meaning whatever good you are putting into your body is actually being pretty much removed by soda. So in short, sugary soda drink is a nutrient remover, especially potassium so you&rsquo;ll need to eat a heck of a lot of fruits and vegetables to counter the damage that soda is doing.</li>\r\n	<li>Drinking soda (and not even very much of it) will contribute to asthma, kidney issues, obesity, heart disease and eczema risk. Every time you drink a soda, your risk of obesity increases 1.6 times.</li>\r\n	<li>People who drink soda are more likely to be smaller in their bone structure because soda breaks down your bones with it&rsquo;s high concentrations of phosphoric acid, which means that when you urinate, you&rsquo;ll excrete out the good calcium from your diet which will deprive your bones of this important mineral. Soda drinkers are usually smaller in their bone structure than non-soda drinkers, for this reason.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How Drinking Soda Makes You High</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The reason we like soda drinks like Coca Cola so much is pretty similar to the reason that junkies like heroin. It works the same way on our pleasure sensors.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Within 20 minutes:</strong>&nbsp;Blood sugar spikes causing insulin burst and your liver to turn any sugar into fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Within 40 minutes:</strong>&nbsp;Pupils dilate, blood pressure rises and the adenosine receptors in your brain are blocked, which caused drowsiness despite all caffeine absorption being complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Within 45 minutes:</strong>&nbsp;Your body ups the dopamine production, which stimulates the pleasure centers of your brain&hellip;tricking you into thinking that it was an enjoyable experience.

Tamara Pitelen.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlantis the Palm Hotel is an attack on the senses. Situated on the furthest most reaches<br />\r\nof Dubai&rsquo;s Palm Jumeirah, its size, grandeur and colour makes it one of the most unmistakable visual references on the city&rsquo;s skyline. It&rsquo;s not all dazzle and drama though. Within the hotel is a spa haven called ShuiQi Spa and Fitness. It is a refined sanctuary of calm within the heady excesses of the main hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me though, I love the blast of colour and size that grabs your eyeballs on first entering the main lobby. From the enormous marine-sculpted white columns to the 10 metre high tower of glass barnacles (comprising 3,000 pieces in total) that reflects the undersea world, as well as the liberal use of brilliant gold paint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this story is about one of the treatments on offer within ShuiQi Spa and Fitness so let&rsquo;s walk through the lobby and over to the right where, as you enter ShuiQi, the sensory assault melts away and becomes more of a soothing sensory caress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast with the hotel lobby, when you step into ShuiQi, the world seems to slow down. Subtle fragrance permeates the air, calming music strokes your earlobes and, for the sake of your retinas, the colour tones are dialed&nbsp;down to more muted turquoise and sea blues. Move downstairs to the treatment area (there&rsquo;s a separate male and female section) and the space is accented with large bowls of orchids, low-lighting and the soothing burble of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INNER STRENGTH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was at ShuiQi to review the Inner Strength Massage (60 minutes). This treatment was specially designed by Geraldine Howard, the woman who co- founded Aromatherapy Associates, at&nbsp;a time when she was at her own lowest ebb amidst treatment for cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howard formulated a special blend&nbsp;of oils and aromas for this particular treatment that aids blood circulation, improves joint pain and defends against breast cancer. Inhalation of these essential oil aromas as well as their application over your body have a healing effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I created this oil at a time when I needed to find my own inner strength. I hope this will help others too,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an hour I was massaged front and back with this oil blend. A wonderfully relaxing and pleasurable experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHAKRA CLEANSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the treatment, there is also a chakra balancing and an energetic removal of negative energy. However,&nbsp;most clients are probably not aware of&nbsp;this as it&rsquo;s happening while your eyes are covered and the therapist does not touch the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a few minutes, the therapist places one hand on your crown&nbsp;chakra (top of the head) and, using a Frankincense oil, holds her other hand over each major chakra, then using a sweeping technique, she draws negative energy out of the body. Although, like&nbsp;I say, most clients are at this stage in a semi-dream state and will be unaware of this energy healing taster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the treatment, you&rsquo;re taken&nbsp;to a relaxation room with sofas, magazines, tea and fruit. A hot lavender bag is placed around your neck and you&rsquo;re invited to tarry as long as you like, using the Jacuzzi, steam and<br />\r\nsauna rooms, and relaxation areas. Who wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend as long as possible here before having to leave the oasis of ShuiQi and step back into the frenetic energy of Dubai?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOP TIP!

(36, 'Food as sunscreen', 'body', 'beauty', 'nutrition', '', '', '<p><em>Use nutrition not sunscreen to protect yourself against sunburn, cancer, and premature aging, writes organic cosmetologist&nbsp;<strong>Shirley Conlon</strong>&nbsp;who is no fan&nbsp;of the chemical-laden sunscreen creams.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, we&rsquo;ve increasingly been told to stay out of the sun to avoid skin cancer or to slather&nbsp;ourselves in sunscreen creams.&nbsp;But is the sun alone really the main&nbsp;culprit in causing skin cancer? Much research suggests that it&rsquo;s not. Many experts believe excessive sunshine, combined with bad lifestyle choices such as highly processed junk foods, caffeine, sugar, nicotine and sweetened fizzy drinks would have a different impact&nbsp;on the skin and could cause sunburn, premature ageing and increasing rates of&nbsp;skin cancer. The sun damages the skin through free radicals and anti-oxidants counteract free radicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the sun is also a major healing force responsible for sustaining all life on earth. Apart from being the most vital nutrient ever, the sun makes you feel good &ndash; just close your eyes and look in the direction of the sun for a couple of minutes (like a sunflower), and you instantly feel the regeneration and energy flow through your body, well, that is if you&rsquo;re not inside hiding from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should we be laying out in the full strength of the sun at midday? No, of course not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overexposure to ultraviolet radiation can be extremely damaging. In the same way that laying unprotected in snow in Antarctica will get you frostbite, over- exposure to sun will burn. As humans, there is a degree to which we need to protect ourselves from the elements but shrinking from the sun like vampires and slathering ourselves in the cocktail of laboratory-created chemicals found in a tube of sunscreen may not be the best solution and in fact may be doing more harm than good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most sun creams block the production of vitamin D and contain a host of carcinogenic ingredients that give a false sense of security by disabling the warning sign &lsquo;sunburn&rsquo; resulting in overexposure to radiation and cell damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some scientists now say that sunscreen may not prevent skin cancer at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VITAMIN D DEBACLE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the UAE is located in a desert yet many of its residents are vitamin D deficient is a pointer to how crazy our lifestyle and concerns have become. The best source of vitamin&nbsp;D is sunlight and studies have found that optimising vitamin D levels could actually help you to prevent at least 16 different types of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theories linking vitamin D deficiency to cancer have been confirmed in more than 200 studies. In fact, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute has published scientific research showing that sunlight exposure reduces the risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American academy of neurology confirms that vitamin D deficiency&nbsp;is associated with dementia and Alzheimers. And one case study in Italy suggests sun exposure improves the survival rate in melanoma patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Joseph Mercola, an alternative medicine practitioner and osteopathic&nbsp;physician, recommends not washing with soap for 48 hours after sun exposure (apart from necessary parts of the body) as chemical soap can rid the skin of vitamin D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOOD AS SUNSCREEN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you build up your body&rsquo;s natural protection against sun damage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting clue from history. The term &lsquo;Redneck&rsquo; comes from colonial times in the southern states of the USA. At the time, farmers lacked B vitamins (the result of not knowing how to treat their crops) and this B vitamin deficiency combined with long periods of sun exposure caused sunburn on the back of their necks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, your first line of defence against sunburn, cancer and premature aging, is consuming a diet high in vitamins and minerals &ndash; a type of edible sunblock, in other words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such good sun-protection foods include: carotenoid rich eggs, spirulina,&nbsp;chlorella, dark-leafy greens and yellow/ orange colours (apricots, cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash). The most potent carotenoid known is astaxanthin found in algae, salmon, trout, shrimp and lobster. Antioxidant rich berries, garlic, tomatoes, green tea, seeds, nuts and off course a good quality Omega 3 fish oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that moderate sun exposure is essential for good health, along with a balanced, antioxidant- rich diet of sun- ripened fruit and vegetables, and gives your body everything Mother Nature intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sensible. If you&rsquo;re going out in the sun, choose appropriate clothing, hats, and umbrellas and consider your skin type. Only on the rare occasions that I would be exposed for an entire day would I use a sunscreen &ndash; ideally a non-toxic brand. Use nutrition along with nature&rsquo;s plant oils to enjoy early morning or afternoon sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all plant oils offer a degree of UV protection; raspberry leaf oil found in&nbsp;SCO Frangipani body oil contains NSPF (natural sun protection factor) of between 28-50 along with sesame, shea, macadamia and avocado with NSPFs between 2-10. Beta-carotene rich calendula, carrot and sea buckthorn all benefit sun-exposed skin. I apply SCO rosehip oil or hydrating serum and shea body butter on my skin but at the same time I am always careful of how long I spend in the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A $5 billion dollar a year industry has a vested interest in promoting the deadly effects of sun exposure from skin cancer to ageing, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder, if some large corporation figured out a way to charge us for sunshine, would it be then start to be marketed as the vital nutrient it actually is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>SHIRLEY CONLON</strong>&nbsp;is the founder of Shirley Conlon Organics, a range of premium skincare products specially developed for hot climates using ethical, eco-friendly ingredients.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Email: shirley@shirleyconlonorganics.com.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>www.shirleyconlonorganics.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BEST BEAUTY BUYS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

(37, 'Visiting Brazilâ€™s John of God', 'body', 'healing', 'meditation', '', '', '<p><em>Every year, thousands of people make the trip to a small town in rural Brazil to visit John of God, a man who&rsquo;s said to do miraculous healings. In 2014,&nbsp;<strong>Natasha Tome</strong>&nbsp;was one of those visitors, here she describes the experience.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a small town in central rural Brazil, there lives a man of humble origins who has healed many thousands of&nbsp;people over the last 38 years from the Casa de Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. Now aged 73 (as of 2014), he&rsquo;s been visited by all and sundry, from the poorest in Brazil who travel over 30 hours by bus to see him, to the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Wayne Dwyer and Shirley MacLaine. While it may sound like a fairy tale, Medium Jo&atilde;o Teixeira de Faria, commonly known as Medium Jo&atilde;o, is a full trance medium that incorporates ascended beings of the light into his body for the healing of others. These beings of light were once incarnated as human doctors, surgeons, and healers and have now taken up the task to offer healing on earth during our lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I sit here in the serene and tranquil Casa garden writing this article, I reflect on my healing path and how it has brought me here to this tiny town in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had been exploring energy healing modalities for years while living in Europe, Asia and the Middle East<br />\r\nwhen my path took me to Dubai-based healers Terri Allen and Buddy Abrahams (official Casa guides). They introduced me to a spiritual hospital in the Brazilian town of Abadi&acirc;nia where I could clear myself energetically of old emotions, hurts, anger, grief, resentment, as well as any physical ailments. Many believe that old stuck emotions can manifest into physical ailments and illnesses if left to fester. Something inside of me clicked when Terri explained the Casa to me and Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s work there. I wanted a clean, clear aura! I didn&rsquo;t want to carry emotional baggage with me for the rest of my life. Added to that was an annoying physical injury from a fall I had taken the year earlier. A left foot and right elbow that were stubbornly refusing to heal. I was ready, willing and able to experience my own divine healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MI CASA SU CASA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not necessary to go to the Casa with guides, it is recommended for first timers. I first went in August 2013 with Terri and Buddy as my guides and then on my own in July 2014. My first visit to the Casa healed me of my physical ailments so on the next visit I requested an emotional healing and clearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o is in attendance at the Casa from Wednesday to Friday so I arrived Tuesday afternoon at my Pousada (inn), a peaceful oasis painted in lilac and white, with an inner courtyard garden with fountain and koi pond. The rooms are basic but adequate and you get three meals per day. I nipped over to the Casa bookshop to buy a supply of bottled water blessed by the entities, which greatly assists with your healing. A quiet dinner and early to bed with excited anticipation of the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising early to the sounds of crowing roosters and chirping birds, I joined the many other white-clad people walking to the Casa. The entities request that everyone wear white so that auras are easily seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were easily hundreds of white- clad people milling around waiting to see Medium Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated entity that day. I heard snatches of conversations in English, German, French, Italian and<br />\r\nof course Portuguese. After standing in the translation line to get my requests translated into Portuguese by a Casa volunteer (Medium Jo&atilde;o only speaks Portuguese), we then waited for our respective lines to be called. Lines for first timers, for repeat visitors, for interventions or revisions, every single person would be seen that day with remarkable organisation. There were people there in wheelchairs, on crutches, children, some&nbsp;sitting fervently in prayer, some laughing in the sunshine with friends, but all with a palpable vibe of hope and faith in the divine healing to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAINTS AND SOUP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Casa grounds, painted in sky blue and white as dictated years ago by its patron saint, Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. The grounds include a bookshop where you&rsquo;ll find several books on healing, healing crystals blessed by the entities, statues, photos, and even t-shirts and bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small caf&eacute; sells delicious Brazilian delicacies, fresh coconut water and juices and hot drinks. There are meditation grounds overlooking a beautiful vista of rolling hills and valleys. You feel far removed from the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world of worries and stresses while at the Casa. The soup kitchen at the Casa serves free healing soup to hundreds each day of the Casa operation and not far from there are the crystal bed rooms where you can sign up for 20 minute intervals on these healing chromotherapy beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also several places of prayer throughout, with triangles (the symbol of the Casa; representing faith, love and charity) for loved ones to place requests, pictures and prayers for those unable to travel to the Casa. The Entity will receive all requests from these triangles and bless them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEETING THE MAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my line shuffled forward to Medium Jo&atilde;o sitting on his chair, we passed through the current rooms where volunteers sat for their own healing and also to help hold the energy for Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated Entity. He sat beside several four-foot high crystals emanating light. As I approached him, nervous, my heart in my throat, I remembered the guidance to look in his eyes as my translator spoke to Jo&atilde;o in rapid Portuguese with my requests. Jo&atilde;o took my hand in his soft hand and as I gazed into his eyes (blue that day, for they are known to change according to whichever Entity is incorporated), I felt he was looking inside me, to my soul, with such love and compassion. He gazed at me for mere seconds, which passed in a daze for me, and muttered something in Portuguese to my translator as he guided me by hand past him. Spiritual intervention that afternoon he&nbsp;had prescribed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each person&rsquo;s case is individual and&nbsp;the Entity might ask you to come back later in the day to visit with a different Entity who specialises in your specific issue, or you may be scheduled for a spiritual intervention, a session on the crystal bed, a visit to the sacred waterfall, passiflora herbs, meditation in the current, or whatever the divine deems you require at that moment in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I returned back that afternoon as requested at 2pm and the intervention line was the first one called. We were brought inside to a healing room to sit in meditation with eyes closed and our hands on our hearts or on the location of where you wanted the most healing. Casa volunteers explained that the entities can work on up to nine issues at once, all you had to do as you sat there was mentally ask. We sat quietly for about 45 minutes feeling waves of energy flowing through me and around me. Lost in my thoughts of what I wanted healed, I heard the deep tones of Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s voice in the room blessing us all and then we were escorted out for the briefing. This was my third spiritual intervention so I knew the drill of immediate bed rest for the next 24 hours, no sun, no physical exertion, and other requirements for the next eight days. First timers would have those restrictions for 40 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o often says he can do 60 per cent of the healing work, and the rest is up to the individual so it was very important that we follow the guidelines given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BED REST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I lay in my room at the Pousada during my ordered 24-hour bed rest, I felt energy and pressure flowing and moving into and throughout my body. Through my abdomen, my head, my ears, my arms and legs. While I had requested healing for three specific issues, I felt the work being done throughout my whole body. Drifting in and out of sleep, at times having a good cry, journaling thoughts and emotions I was releasing, after the 24 hours was up, I felt cleaner, lighter, brighter and renewed. I felt like I was glowing from within. Physically I saw that my eyes were brighter, my skin fresher and smoother, and emotionally I felt like all emotions and thoughts that I&rsquo;d been holding onto that were not for my highest good had been pulled out of me and transmuted into nothingness. I was full of life plans and actions steps that I was eager to start on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day I headed early to the Casa to sit in the current room. While we sit there to help hold the energy and vibration for the divine healing work being done on our earthly plane, it is also a time when a phalange of entities work the room and heal those walking through, as well as those sitting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After each current session, I felt amazing. My mood was uplifted, I felt love and compassion for everyone, I didn&rsquo;t judge and I felt benevolence for everyone and everything. I feel like I have had a profound spiritual awakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING &amp; EMOTIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my last night in Abadi&acirc;nia, I spoke with an American woman at my Pousada who had come to Brazil with breast cancer. Diagnosed in September 2013, she did not want surgery nor radiation or chemotherapy. Her medical doctor called her daily advising her to get surgery or she will die. Instead she went to a naturopath who suggested it was an emotional block and perhaps she should go to Brazil to visit Medium Jo&atilde;o at the Casa. Two spiritual interventions later and another one during the night in her room, she told me she physically felt scalpels cutting into her breast, to her lymph node. She felt the pain, the heat, of work being done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many books written about Medium Jo&atilde;o and the successful healings he has orchestrated over the years but nothing can replace the awe of being at the Casa in person, feeling the energy, watching crutches being thrown aside as a person feebly makes their first unaided step, watching crying children immediately fall asleep after sipping blessed water while waiting in the lines, and just feeling the divine love and compassion pouring out of Medium Jo&atilde;o himself. A man who has devoted his life to being a vehicle of healing for others. As he often says, &ldquo;I do not cure anybody. God is the one who cures.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTACTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official website of the Casa<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.joaodedeusabadiania.com/\">www.joaodedeusabadiania.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubai-based Casa guides Terri and Buddy Abrahams<br />\r\nhttp://angelsoflightonline.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br />\r\nNATASHA TOME is an Atlantean Energy Healing practitioner and freelance writer based in Dubai, UAE.<br />\r\nEmail: natasha@whitelotuslight.com</p>\r\n', 'John-of-God-by-Cande-Salles-702x526-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 05:57:04'),

The latest science is now telling us that we need to eat fat to lose fat.&nbsp;<strong>Tamara Pitelen</strong>&nbsp;reports.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fats are back in fashion. After decades of being obsessed with low and no fat foods to try and&nbsp;lose weight, the scientists are now telling us we got it all wrong. Fats are no longer the bad guy. Poor old fats got an undeserved bad rep so we all strived to eliminate them from our diets. What happened? We all got an awful lot fatter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US physician Mark Hyman, author of books such as&nbsp;<em>The Blood Sugar Solution</em>&nbsp;and founder of the UltraWellness Centre, says, &ldquo;Fat does not make you fat. That was the old theory. Fat has nine calories per grams and carbs have four calories per gram so the conclusion was that if you eat more carbs, you&rsquo;ll lose weight, no. Is a calorie a calorie a calorie? No.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking at an online wellness summit in 2014, Hyman said it was an unfortunate error that we use the same word for &lsquo;fats&rsquo; that we do for &lsquo;being fat&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The language got messed up so we think that if we eat fat we&rsquo;ll become fat. No, in fact the opposite is often true, there are some fascinating studies, when they control the fat and the carbs. Even on the same calories, the people who eat more fat will actually lose more weight, increase their metabolism and lose belly fat, all of this happens by increasing the fat and decreasing the refined carbs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Oliver, a UK-based Nutritional Therapist who works with clients in the Middle East, agrees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver says the low fat movement of the last 40 years has done a huge amount of damage and we should all be eating a lot more fat, particularly fish oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAT IN FRUCTOSE OUT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone this weird way down&nbsp;the sweet and low fat road and so we have a global epidemic of diseases<br />\r\nthat were rare 40 years ago, such as obesity and heart disease, liver disease, inflammation and diabetes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s about getting more quality fats and less sugars, Oliver says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fats change the way your body absorbs food, it&rsquo;s called gastric emptying &ndash; the speed at which the&nbsp;food enters your blood stream. So if you have a chocolate bar for example, it&rsquo;s going to get in there very, very fast; send you into a massive high blood sugar peak from which you&rsquo;ll crash. But if you have a piece of meat and some green leafy vegetables, it might look like a lot of food but actually&nbsp;the gastric emptying will be much slower and more sustained, you&rsquo;ll get the amino acids you need which will keep you slimmer and manage your weight, it&rsquo;ll keep your muscle mass maintained which means a higher resting metabolic rate. All round we need to move back to a high natural fat and low sugar diet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fat also reduces our desire for sweet foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In the UK and US, there&rsquo;s a big swing to the Paleolithic diet and when we apply that to our clients here in the Middle East, my goodness the weight- loss is incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When they come to us, our Middle Eastern clients are on high sugar diets with lots of fried and pastry type foods and fruit juices that they actually sweeten with sugar when I visit their houses, which I find crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We met our first Saudi clients eight years ago, it was two princesses; two sisters from Riyadh. They came to London and trained with us for six weeks, their programme comprised weight-training, personal training, cardio, etc, also totally changing&nbsp;their diets by looking at the micro and macro nutrient intakes, taking out most sugars. The results were incredible and they looked amazing. So, stick to meats, fishes, vegetables, fruit&hellip; not too many fruit juices because the fructose levels are very high, fructose is as bad as a can of Coke as how your body recognises it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SWISH FISH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural animal fats are very easily assimilated by the body, which is why Eskimos have the highest fat intake on&nbsp;the planet and yet also have incredible health statistics; almost no inflammation, no arthritis or diabetes, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Oliver, we should be eating 10 portions of oily fish a week like sardines, mackerels, herring, and anchovies to keep our brains and bodies in top shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But I know people won&rsquo;t. These types of fish are not in vogue and our palates have been manipulated to favour sweet things.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why should we be eating so much oily fish? In order to get enough phospholipids; an integral part of our cellular membrane make-up. Sixty&nbsp;per cent of the human brain and eye retina is made up of DHA fat and phospholipids have permeability into the brain, which provides protection against diseases such as ADHD, ADD, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, Dementia, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Phospholipids are for brain health, eye health, heart health, they have cholesterol-reducing properties and control blood sugar, they&rsquo;re for fat metabolism, for liver health, and are a neurotransmitter so they work synergistically with DHA for brain health. We don&rsquo;t eat anywhere near enough phospholipids anymore.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fish roe, or caviar, is one of the&nbsp;few food sources of phospholipids. Sensing a market opportunity, Oliver recently launched a fish oil supplement called Omega 3 MOPL, a sustainably- harvested Herring Caviar that provides DHA, EPA, Omega 3, Phospholipids and Choline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver says he gets consistent feedback on his supplement about improved joint health, bowel function and inflammation as well as skin conditions like excema, psoriasis&nbsp;and dermatitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We worked with His Highness Sheikh Butti bin Maktoum, he was taking our product. He&rsquo;d been taking another fish oil product for 20 years and he said that within five days&nbsp;of taking our product, the arthritis&nbsp;in his hands was gone &ndash; we get a&nbsp;lot of anecdotal feedback about inflammatory joint issues &ndash; a month later he told me his cholesterol was down to normal for the first time in 20 years. All he&rsquo;d done was change his fish oil product.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Omega 3 MOPL fish oil supplement by Tom Oliver Nutrition is available exclusively through Holland &amp; Barrett outlets in the UAE.

(39, 'Reversing diabetes naturally', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>Forty years ago, Type 2 diabetes was a rare disease almost unknown outside of the elderly. Today, it&rsquo;s running rampant through the global adult population and alongside obesity is a new epidemic amongst children and teens. In the Middle East, a staggering 35 million people are diabetic, many millions more are pre-diabetic. How are our changing lifestyles contributing to the soaring rates of this devastating disease and can we turn back the tide without a lifetime of insulin injections.&nbsp;<strong>Chloe Elgar</strong>&nbsp;reports.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes is prevalent and chronic. In just one generation, it&rsquo;s gone from being relatively rare to a condition so common, it&rsquo;s a household word. Most of us know at least one person suffering from the disease. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a global health problem. How did this disease become so proliferate around the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the International Diabetes Federation, 382 million people are suffering from diabetes worldwide. Here in the Middle East and North Africa, 35 million people have the disease. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar take spots number seven, nine and 10 on the world&rsquo;s list of Top 10 countries/territories for age adjusted prevalence percentage of diabetes in 2013. The UAE comes in at number 15 out of 219 countries, with a diabetes rate of 18.9 per cent of the population. The Saudi figure is 23.9 per cent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no better time to evaluate the region&rsquo;s health and give more attention to preventative health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT IS DIABETES?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes Mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases with an uncontrollably high blood glucose level as a result of either the body&rsquo;s resistance to insulin (Type I) or because the body does not effectively produce insulin (Type 2), or both. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, which acts like a key, essentially, opening the cell&rsquo;s doors to accept glucose from the blood. Without the effective use of insulin, glucose remains in the blood stream, negatively affecting the body&rsquo;s successive processes and balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When present in the body over many years, diabetes can create imbalances that cause heart disease, neuropathy, kidney disease and retinopathy. If these conditions are left untreated, issues like neuropathy can lead to amputation of limbs due to severe circulatory problems, vascular disease (damage to the blood vessels) or infection. According to the American Diabetes Association, the highest reports of amputations in the world occur in diabetic patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the question begs: Can diabetes be reversed with food and exercise? There are many-recorded cases of people who are proving to decrease and effectively manage their blood sugar levels, and even eliminate their need for needles and insulin, naturally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONVENTIONAL ALLOPATHIC TREATMENT<br />\r\nIf you go to your traditional Western- educated GP, the typical route of treatment for those people who are pre-diabetic or who have full-blown diabetes includes a rigid schedule of blood glucose testing, administering regular insulin either with insulin injections or an insulin pump, and supplementing with other medications including diabetes pills and aspirin. Diabetes is seen as incurable and once you have it, it&rsquo;s a downhill run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allopathic medicine prescribes a plan for diabetes based on treatment and survival, which varies depending on the severity of your diabetes and whether you have Type I or Type 2. The conventional outlook is that these treatments will be a part of the rest of your life from the point of diagnosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another route however. Alternative medicine offers a path promoting prevention of disease and a way back from a lifetime of injections. This path includes nutrition education, plant-based food and more focus on the mind-body connection. Although the conventional route seems easier and more immediate at first, taking a look further down the road may make you think twice before agreeing to an insulin pump-regulated future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our bodies are incredibly efficient and intelligent machines and are constantly sending us messages to demonstrate what is going on beneath the surface. These messages and signs are what we refer to as symptoms. The key is not to cover-up the symptoms with medicine and pills, rather, to listen to them in order to understand a much deeper root; the cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE TREE OF LIFE FOUNDATION<br />\r\nIt is no longer a question of prevalence or relevance. Diabetes numbers are growing rapidly and the big question is: is it reversible and preventable? According to Dr. Gabriel Cousens, the answer to that is, absolutely, yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Gabriel Cousens is a pioneer in the Alternative Medicine world and is known for his innovative<br />\r\nwork with diabetes. Based on 40 years of clinical research working with diabetes, Cousens opened the Tree of Life foundation, and created the &lsquo;Diabetes Reversal Program&rsquo; a medically supervised rejuvenation clinic where guests are immersed in a world of dietary, nutritional and lifestyle education related to building awareness and empowerment around holistic health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fundamental premise of the Tree of Life Foundation is that disease is caused from imbalances in the body. Dr. Cousens created a 21-day programme where guests are immersed in holistic health through nutrition education, natural plant- based food, exercise and meditation. Every meal (including snacks) is 100 per cent organic, vegan and living plant-based food, which includes vegetable and fruit-based juices, smoothies and unlimited wheatgrass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the first 110 participants to attend Dr. Cousens program, 60 per cent of the Type II diabetics were off all oral medications with recorded fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels under 100. Out of all Type II guests, 28 per cent reversed their diabetes after three weeks with no insulin and a FBS level under 100. Amazingly, 100 per cent of the non-insulin pre-diabetic guests were completely healed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach is in stark contrast to the one often &ndash; but not always &ndash; prescribed by an allopathic doctor. Madyson Page, who undertook Dr. Cousen&rsquo;s Tree of Life Diabetes Recovery Program, was told by her GP that she would not have to make lifestyle changes because of diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My doctor told me I could eat whatever I wanted and just give myself a little insulin. She told me, &lsquo;Your life doesn&rsquo;t have to change&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dr. Cousens, the rise of diabetes is a symptom of global disharmony. &ldquo;That disharmony in terms of eating is coming in the pandemic we call diabetes. White sugar, white flour and the introduction of high fructose corn syrup are the main culprits. Also, a high incidence of animal fat are key players but it&rsquo;s really the sugar that&rsquo;s the number one cause.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on Dr. Gabriel Cousens and his Diabetes Reversal Program, watch his documentary Simply Raw: Reversing Diabetes in 30 days, or read his book, There is a Cure for Diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOLISTIC HEALTH KIT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to holistic nutrition, the key is to look at the body as a whole functioning unit, as opposed to singling out one system, organ or symptom to treat. With diabetes, keeping the blood sugar levels down with extra insulin isn&rsquo;t going to solve the core imbalance long-term. Addressing one single symptom (high blood sugar) ignores all other contributing factors such as low immune system, high stress, toxin overload, gastrointestinal problems and poor diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, with diabetes, the body is demonstrating an imbalance and inability to regulate and produce insulin. Thus, adding more insulin to the blood stream, which is left circulating overtime, can lead to further issues with the pancreas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, there are key steps to follow if you are pre-diabetic or have Type I or Type 2 diabetes, which will begin your journey to reversing your condition naturally. Treat these recommendations as your starter kit on how to take your health back into your own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Gain control of your body&rsquo;s insulin levels</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This involves limiting consumption of sugars, processed grains and refined carbohydrates. Substitute these foods with natural whole foods, good quality fats (coconut oil, cold-pressed and extra virgin olive oil, nuts and seeds, fish oil, avocado and ghee), protein and green vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Ban junk, especially sugar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Always have healthy snacks on hand and remove unhealthy foods from your house so that you aren&rsquo;t tempted: Nuts and seeds, hummus, fruit, nut butters, vegetables (carrot, cucumber, celery)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Restore balance in your gut</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gastrointestinal tract is the area of nutrient assimilation and therefore hugely influences your body&rsquo;s overall health. Correcting an imbalance involves identifying food intolerances, re-balancing your gut bacteria with a probiotic and improving the overall absorption and assimilation of vitamins and minerals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Exercise daily</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This could be yoga, walking, stretching, resistance training or cycling. Make sure it&rsquo;s exercise that you enjoy doing &ndash; one that helps&nbsp;to relieve stress. You don&rsquo;t have to climb mountains or do Ironman triathlons; a 30 minute brisk walk every day will do wonders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Substitute unhealthy foods with healthier alternatives</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take out: fried foods, carbonatedbeverages (colas, sparkling water), artificial sweeteners, processed foods and sugar, table salt and refined carbohydrates (bread, pasta, biscuits)</li>\r\n	<li>Bring in: whole, natural foods including: fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds, whole grains (quinoa, rice, amaranth), legumes, fish, herbal teas, coconut water</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Water is a wonder<br />\r\nDrink anywhere from 3 to 5 litres of water per day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Never skip meals<br />\r\nKeeping blood sugar levels stable means eating smaller amounts every few hours &ndash; avoid the famine and feast pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Keep a rhythm<br />\r\nHave regularity in your life, take regular meals, regular sleep times and wake up at a regular time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Reduce stress<br />\r\nStress plays a major role in your body and an over- production of the stress hormone cortisol can, overtime, cause hormone imbalance, adrenal fatigue and consequently affect your body&rsquo;s insulin levels and blood sugar regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-and-amputation.html http://healthintelligence.drupalgardens.com/content/prevalence-diabetes-world-2013 http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/other-treatments/<br />\r\nhttp://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/<br />\r\nhttp://www.treeoflifefoundation.org/service/reversing-diabetes-2/</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CASE STUDY: DIMPLE JIVOTHAMA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dubai-expat Dimple Jivothama reversed her diabetes naturally and lost 26 kgs in the process.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dimple Jivothama was just 32 when she was diagnosed as pre-diabetic after going to a routine check-up.

(40, 'Beyond the last goodbye', 'body', 'healing', 'meduimship', '', '', '<p><em>Journalist and author&nbsp;<strong>Karina Machado&nbsp;</strong>spoke to over 60 Australians who said they could sense around them the spirit of a loved one who had died. From their stories, Machado wrote the book Love Never Dies to show the indestructibility of love. This is one of the stories from the book.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most teenaged siblings, Bianca, age 15, and her brother, Stephen, 18, occasionally argued&nbsp;over trivial things &ndash; an ill-judged joke, the distribution of chores, taunts shaped like arrows aimed at the heart. But beneath the bickering, the pair were bound by a closeness that informed their lives &ndash; a sense of togetherness they took for granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 August 1988, Bianca rose early. Her grandmother had been staying at their home in north Sydney to care for Bianca and her sister, Torrie, aged nine, while their single mum juggled two jobs. Since leaving school two years earlier, Stephen, too, helped support his mother and sisters. Now their grandmother wanted to drive back to her apartment on the central coast of New South Wales, to attend to gather more belongings, before returning to Sydney to continue looking after her grandchildren. Bianca and Torrie were going with her for the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morning was crisp and dazzling, the sky a bowl of brightest blue, but Bianca was in no mood to appreciate it. Today marked four days since she and Stephen had stopped speaking to each other. Charged silences, crossed arms and downturned mouths filled the spaces in their relationship where laughter and camaraderie usually dwelled. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t really remember why we weren&rsquo;t talking,&rsquo; says Bianca, whose calm and matter-of-fact voice cracks, to her surprise, as she recalls events from a quarter of a century ago. &lsquo;And because I was younger than him,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was full of pride. I would never talk to him first &ndash; he would have to talk to me first and apologise to me first. I was very stubborn. I would never try and repair the arguments.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LAST GOODBYE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving her bedroom with an overnight bag slung across her shoulder, she stopped short outside Stephen&rsquo;s room, neighbouring her own. His door was open but he was still in bed. &lsquo;I actually&nbsp;said, &ldquo;Goodbye, Stephen,&rdquo; and that was&nbsp;very unusual,&rsquo; Bianca says. Looking&nbsp;up at his sister, Stephen&rsquo;s wide-set eyes mirrored her confusion. She had no idea why she&rsquo;d paused here, why she&rsquo;d broken her usual resolve. &lsquo;Oh! Bye, Bianca,&rsquo; he said, with a glimmer of his characteristic cheekiness, before returning his gaze to the ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their grandmother beamed, grateful the kids were getting on again. &lsquo;She said to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you for saying goodbye to him,&rdquo;&rsquo; remembers Bianca, her words pitching and dipping. &lsquo;That was the last time I spoke to him.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that Friday night, Bianca and her sister were at their grandmother&rsquo;s trying to connect the video recorder they&rsquo;d given her for her birthday. Pressing buttons here and there, Bianca managed to set the time display. As&nbsp;her grandmother prepared dinner&nbsp;in the kitchen, Bianca found herself mesmerised by the numbers on the digital display: 6.35. &lsquo;I was just staring at the time and feeling really quite homesick for some reason, I just wanted to be home.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next morning, her mother and uncle arrived at her grandmother&rsquo;s house &ndash; unexpectedly. Drawn to the window by the thud of slamming doors, Bianca watched them approach, aware in some way that in seconds &ndash; the time it took for them to reach the door &ndash; this life would cease for her and another would take its place. Everything was about to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her grandmother opened the door. Dread spilt inside Bianca, spreading like a bloodstain in waves of zinging heat that crept up her spine and across her belly. Icy, pulsing fire that told her what she&rsquo;d experienced last night, tuning the video recorder, was preparing her for this. Still dressed in her work clothes from the day before, her mother was like a broken doppelganger of herself.<br />\r\nIt seemed she was covered in a network of fissures, where one misstep would see her crumble into shards on the welcome mat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Bianca&rsquo;s uncle stepped forward and &lsquo;sort of grabbed us,&rsquo; she recalls. He said, &lsquo;Stephen&rsquo;s had an accident.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up through the tunnel of years,&nbsp;his sister&rsquo;s hazel eyes grow red from weeping. Twenty-five winters have rushed by, Bianca is now 40 years old, a mother of two, a registered nurse who&rsquo;s weathered much in her life and work &ndash; but the news that her brother was dead felt like an assault. Twenty-five winters doesn&rsquo;t change that; the pain is frozen in time, perfectly preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way Stephen is forever young, I think, studying a photo Bianca sends me. Tall and slim, posing astride his beloved motorbike, bought with proceeds of one of his first pay packets, the dark-haired teen has the swagger of a young George Clooney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Stephen, the combination of youth, inexperience and his passion for bikes proved lethal. As Bianca&rsquo;s uncle explained that awful Saturday morning, Stephen had been killed riding his motorbike the previous evening. His passenger, a friend he was picking up to take to a party, also died. The accident happened at 6.35pm, the precise moment Bianca found herself hypnotised by the pulsing digital clock on the VCR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPIRIT VISITS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grieving family made the trip back to Sydney. All was the same yet nothing was. Time itself was twisted out of shape. &lsquo;For about a week after his death, I&rsquo;d wake up in the mornings and hear his motorbike in the driveway, revving up to go to work,&rsquo; says Bianca. &lsquo;It was quite loud in my ears, you know, and then I had to remind myself that he&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahead of the funeral, family came to stay and their little home was packed. To make space, Bianca and her mum moved into Stephen&rsquo;s room, sleeping side by side in his double bed. On the eve of the service, Bianca&rsquo;s mum was out cold after taking a sleeping tablet, but Bianca sat up reading, battling a&nbsp;gnawing unease. Something was about to happen. The knowing manifested as anxiety, as an inability to pin down the words on the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She set aside her book and looked towards the end of the bed. There was Stephen, wearing his favourite black- and-grey striped dress shirt, the one his mum had given the funeral directors. The one he&rsquo;s wearing in the photo with his motorbike, staring down the lens of a truncated future. In the stark glare of the overhead light, as his mother slept, he was revealed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;It was as bright as anything in that room,&rsquo; marvels Bianca. There were no shadows to dart into or mould into&nbsp;shapes, no dreams to beg back, no dim lamplight to blur the truth. There was only Stephen.&nbsp;He knelt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;All I could see was from his abdomen up and his hands were together, as if he was praying, and he was really staring at Mum and I. He was looking straight at us.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bianca&rsquo;s fear melted away when she saw him. &lsquo;I felt scared beforehand because I knew something was going to happen, but I didn&rsquo;t quite know what. And then he just appeared to me, and the feeling that I got &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t talking &ndash; was, &ldquo;Look after Mum&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s what I felt he was trying to communicate. Then I closed my eyes and he was gone.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bianca watched her brother for only &lsquo;seconds&rsquo; but it was enough &lsquo;to really see him clearly&rsquo;. His image is branded onto her heart: &lsquo;There was a transparency to him. He was grey, but I could see him as clear as anything,&rsquo; she repeats. &lsquo;His eyes were wide open. He had big, dark blue eyes and he was just looking at us and he looked sad.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterwards, Bianca went to sleep easily, which she concedes was strange, but it&rsquo;s in keeping with many other such encounters with the spirits of loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In quiet moments, she still tries to decipher the message in his stance and expression. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why he was kneeling down at the end of the bed, with his hands together in prayer,&rsquo; says Bianca, whose family is Catholic but not strictly so. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that was just to let me know he was going&nbsp;to God or whether he was taking that stance not to frighten me. I&rsquo;m not sure.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She often wonders why he appeared so troubled. &lsquo;It could have been regret and feeling sorry that he&rsquo;s left us. He was a bit reckless,&rsquo; muses Bianca. &lsquo;I guess he was the man of the house and he was worried about leaving us.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen wore the same heartbroken look during an encounter at a cinema two weeks later, when Bianca was stunned to see his gaze locked on hers in the mirror behind the ticket counter as she paid for an ice cream. &lsquo;I saw his eyes,&rsquo; she recalls. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;d say he superimposed himself on me, because I was expecting to see me. He was just staring, really staring at me.&rsquo; This time, Bianca was very shaken and the two friends who&rsquo;d suggested an outing to the movies to take her mind off things helped soothe and calm her. Stephen appeared to share her shock. &lsquo;He could see that I was frightened because he looked scared, too. And then he looked down at the ground, like in a sad way.&rsquo; Then&nbsp;he vanished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DREAMS AND ANSWERS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For two years, Stephen regularly visited Bianca in her dreams, usually just as a watchful presence on the sidelines. But some were much&nbsp;more powerful. The first and &lsquo;most significant&rsquo; of these took place around&nbsp;a month after the accident. One morning, Bianca and a friend rode their pushbikes to the accident scene and talked about what had happened, trying to understand the sequence&nbsp;of events that had led to Stephen&rsquo;s death. That night, she had the dream. Stephen, and the boy who&rsquo;d died with him, were standing in front of her, exactly as they&rsquo;d been in life. &lsquo;Stephen said to me, &ldquo;Bianca, do you want&nbsp;to see how we died?&rdquo; Like it was an everyday sort of question. And I said, &ldquo;Yes, I do want to know.&rdquo; And so he showed me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;It was like I was actually sitting on the motorbike, watching what they would have seen. He showed me how they hit the back of the car in front and then they flew over to the opposite side of the road.&rsquo; In what was perhaps a tender gesture on Stephen&rsquo;s part, any disturbing details were omitted. &lsquo;He just showed me the impact with the car in front, how the motorbike tipped up and then they &hellip;once they came off the bike, it just went white, nothing.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she woke up, Bianca felt free&nbsp;of her desperation to know how he&rsquo;d gone. Her burden lifted: &lsquo;He answered my question.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today Bianca, who first showed signs of having increased psychic awareness in childhood, rarely senses Stephen&rsquo;s spirit anymore. &lsquo;I think he&rsquo;s just moved on, you know. But I think he hung around us for a long while because it must have been an awful shock for him to have had the accident and to leave us. That was really sad.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet there is less grief now, when Bianca thinks of her big brother. Seeing him again on that distant night was&nbsp;a gift that continues to yield, more so with every year that drifts by. &lsquo;I just&nbsp;feel really privileged to have had that experience, which was so special and amazing,&rsquo; she reflects. &lsquo;I feel really happy that there is another life beyond this life that we live. I think we go to a happier place, and a safer place. I feel at peace.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She knows this is the case for Stephen, too, knows his velvet navy eyes are ablaze with light and infinite love, as he watches over her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"LoveNeverDies_CON8Â­cmyk\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LoveNeverDies_CON8%C2%ADcmyk-297x450.jpg\" style=\"height:213px; width:141px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This story is an extract from Love Never Dies by KARINA MACHADO.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Published by Pan Macmillan Australia.

(41, 'Confessions of an apprentice Yoga Teacher', 'body', 'body', 'yoga', '', 'fitness', '<p><em>The ultimate aim of yoga is not sticking your knee behind your head. It&rsquo;s a journey to knowing who</em><br />\r\n<em>you really are and to connecting with universal consciousness. If that&rsquo;s not hippie, trippy, peace, love and lentils for you, keep reading&hellip;&nbsp;<strong>Tamara Pitelen</strong>&nbsp;writes about being a newly graduated yoga teacher.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m now officially qualified to teach yoga to others. I have a bit of paper that says I am. Despite the bit of&nbsp;paper though, I still feel like a beginner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ancient yoga scriptures, there are about 8,400,000 yoga poses (asanas) but today we tend to focus on about 84 of them. Forget the eight million, I can&rsquo;t even do all&nbsp;of the 84 basic poses. The Scorpion pose for example, I couldn&rsquo;t do that&nbsp;to save my life just yet (it&rsquo;s a forearm stand, in case you&rsquo;re wondering) and maybe I never will do it but one of&nbsp;the epiphanies I had about yoga in&nbsp;my 200 hours of training was that not being able to do Scorpion &lsquo;properly&rsquo; really doesn&rsquo;t matter. In fact, not being able to do any of the postures properly really doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s more important to simply regularly practise to the best of your ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Regularity is key; intensity is not,&rdquo; said my teacher Roshan Singh, the founder of Rishikesh Yog Peeth, a yoga school in the foothills of the Himalayas in the Indian town of Rishikesh, a town that claims the title &lsquo;world capital of yoga&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yoga is accepting the body&rsquo;s limitations; working up to the limitations because the limits are dynamic, if you work to your limit, the limit will shift,&rdquo; Roshan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stress or strain. Injury is the result of working past the body&rsquo;s limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you&rsquo;re moving your body daily, it will improve. Be gentle and kind to yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YOGA FOR FAT OLDIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I went to Rishikesh, I&rsquo;d been worried that I wasn&rsquo;t ready for yoga teacher training. I was worried that&nbsp;I&rsquo;d be too old, too fat, too inflexible. I thought yoga teachers had to be 20 or 30-something perfect-bodies who could put their knees behind their ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, I was wrong. It&rsquo;s a common misconception in the appearance-obsessed west. On my training course there were people aged 18 to 60 of all sizes and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yoga is not a performance art&nbsp;or competitive sport. Every body is unique, beautiful and special. Your triangle looks different to mine because our bodies are of different ratios and proportions,&rdquo; said Roshan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Understanding and accepting your anatomical possibilities and limitations is the start of yoga.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, yoga, it turns out, is not about having a perfect body or standing on your head for longer than the person beside you. It&rsquo;s not a gymnastics feat about who&rsquo;s bendier than who. It&rsquo;s also not about taking photos of yourself doing poses in exotic locations and putting them on Facebook (although that looks like fun so if you do do that, all power to you). In fact, doing the poses is only one small part of a traditional yoga practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YOGA OR ASANA TEACHER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Are you going to be a yoga teacher or&nbsp;an asana teacher?&rdquo; This was the question Roshan put to my class towards the end of our training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he meant was, when you go back to your own country and start teaching others, will you forget about the spiritual aspects of yoga and concentrate only on the physical part? Or will you remember that the poses are just one slice of the yoga pie? The other parts include breathing exercises, inward focus, concentration and meditation as well as personal disciplines such as non-violence and truthfulness towards yourself and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A LITTLE THING CALLED ENLIGHTENMENT<br />\r\nBefore going to Rishikesh, I didn&rsquo;t realise that the ultimate purpose of yoga was to achieve enlightenment, aka Samadhi. That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spending hours cross-legged in meditation, chanting Om, bending backwards and forwards, twisting this way and that, doing strange breathing exercises, etc. It&rsquo;s all in aid of this one goal, which is to activate the kundalini energy at the base of your spine so that it travels up to the crown chakra on top of your head causing the 1,000 petal lotus chakra to open up. When this happens, your individual consciousness merges with universal consciousness and you have achieved enlightenment. You become one with everything and nothing is ever the same again. Apparently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do you get this kundalini energy moving? The idea is that if your body, mind, emotions, brain chemistry, hormones and so on are all in perfect balance and harmony, the kundalini&nbsp;will awaken. Or so I&rsquo;m told. For me it&rsquo;s&nbsp;all theoretical knowledge at the stage.&nbsp;To date, the lotus flower in my crown chakra remains stubbornly closed and&nbsp;the kundalini energy would seem to be comatose at the base of my spine, not in a big hurry to be travelling upwards anytime soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BACK TO REALITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I write this, it&rsquo;s been four months since I graduated from yoga school. I&rsquo;m now teaching four classes a week at Yoga Ashram, a yoga studio in JLT, Dubai. I&rsquo;m enjoying the teaching more and more. At first I was too nervous but I&rsquo;m relaxing a little now and it&rsquo;s a real buzz when students tell you they really enjoyed the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I still go to the yoga classes of other teachers because I have such a long way to go with my own practice. I also love seeing how other teachers structure a class, how they explain poses or include breathing and meditation exercises. I still can&rsquo;t do Scorpion &ndash; not even close! And I&rsquo;ve found that bringing a regular yoga practice back into &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life after the teacher training can require some effort &ndash; I sometimes slip a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re in an ashram up in the mountains, far away from your regular life and concerns and all you have to do every day is practice and study yoga. It&rsquo;s easy to be all zen-like and &lsquo;namaste&rsquo; about everything. You have the freedom to spend hours on breathing exercises, meditation and the chanting of Om and Sanskrit mantras. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to feel love for humanity when you&rsquo;re not dealing with traffic on&nbsp;Sheikh Zayed Road and spending eight hours a day at a computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically though, the time you need yoga and meditation&nbsp;the most is when you think you&rsquo;re too&nbsp;busy to spare the time for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Come along! Tamara&nbsp;holds a donation-only&nbsp;Hatha yoga class, to raise money for Dubai&rsquo;s stray animals, on Saturdays at 12.45pm at Yoga Ashram, JLT, Cluster X, Office 1504, Dubai, UAE.&nbsp;www.yogaashram.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SO YOU WANNA BE A YOGA TEACHER?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>A brief guide to yoga teacher certification&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although yoga as a practice took shape some 5000 or so years ago, a couple&nbsp;of organisations today have managed to position themselves as the regulatory authorities that decide who can and can&rsquo;t teach yoga. Such bodies include Yoga Alliance and the British Wheel of Yoga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In theory, all you really need to do is study Patanjali&rsquo;s Yoga Sutras, a book written in AD400 or so by the grandfather of yoga, Patanjali.&nbsp;Although yoga had been around for thousands of years before that, Patanjali&rsquo;s book is, as far as we know, one of the first attempts to give it a structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today though, if you want to teach in a yoga studio or gym, you&rsquo;ll need a certificate from a recognised regulatory body and Yoga Alliance certification has become the default global standard. The first level involves 200 hours of training and the official term is a 200 hour Yoga Alliance Registered Yoga Teacher &ndash; or RYT 200. Once you&rsquo;ve got your RYT 200, there are no hard and fast rules for progressing but for some the next step is to get 100 hours of teaching experience and then do the 500 hour training, RYT 500. For teachers who have clocked up 1000 hours of teaching experience, they can registered themselves as E-RYT 200. The E stands for &lsquo;experienced&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what does 200 hours of yoga training involve? It varies between schools but at the school I went to, Rishikesh Yog Peeth in India, this was a typical day:<br />\r\nw 05:30 am &ndash; Wake Up<br />\r\nw 06:00 am &ndash; Cinnamon tea<br />\r\nw 06:15 am &ndash; Cleansing rituals like nasal cleansing with a neti pot<br />\r\nw 06:30 am &ndash; Pranayama (breathing) and chanting<br />\r\nw 07:30 am &ndash; Yoga therapy/Yoga Asana<br />\r\nw 09:00 am &ndash; Breakfast<br />\r\nw 10:30 am &ndash; Yoga Therapy<br />\r\nw 11:30 am &ndash; Yoga Philosophy<br />\r\nw 12:30 pm &ndash; Lunch<br />\r\nw 03:30 pm &ndash; Yoga Anatomy<br />\r\nw 04:30 pm &ndash; Yoga breathing and yoga nidra w 05:00 pm &ndash; Hatha/Ashtanga asanas<br />\r\nw 06:45 pm &ndash; Pranayama and meditation<br />\r\nw 07:15 pm &ndash; Dinner<br />\r\nw 10.00 pm &ndash; Lights Out</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Techniques and practice make the bulk of the training as 100 hours is allotted to that. Methodology takes up 25 hours while 20 hours go to learning anatomy and physiology. You need to devote 30 hours to philosophy and ethical conduct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on studying yoga at Rishikesh Yog Peeth, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rishikeshyogpeeth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.rishikeshyogpeeth.com</a></p>\r\n', 'warrior-1-woman-702-x-526-701x336.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:45:45');

Reconnective healing founder Dr. Eric Pearl says &lsquo;absolutely&rsquo;. He has facilitated healings for conditions as varied as cerebral palsy, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, immune diseases, birth defects, cancers, sciatica, deafness, and more&hellip; often for people who&rsquo;d been told by the best in the medical profession that nothing could be done for them.</em><br />\r\n<em>It sounds too good to be true but is it?&nbsp;Prior to Dr. Pearl&rsquo;s arrival in Dubai to hold seminars,&nbsp;<strong>Tamara Pitelen</strong>spoke to him about what&nbsp;Reconnective Healing is and isn&rsquo;t.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is Reconnective Healing? I&rsquo;ll get&nbsp;to that in a minute. First, let&rsquo;s look at what it&rsquo;s not. According to its founder,&nbsp;Dr. Eric Pearl, Reconnective Healing is not a treatment,&nbsp;therapy or cure. Nor is it a technique, a modality or&nbsp;a system. He says there is no diagnosis, there&rsquo;s no&nbsp;determining the problem, there&rsquo;s no treating, there&rsquo;s no therapy, there&rsquo;s no attempting&nbsp;to cure or fix. This might seem surprising for something entitled&nbsp;&lsquo;healing&rsquo; and it does beg the question &lsquo;so what is it then?&rsquo; but keep reading, it becomes&nbsp;clearer&hellip; and more incredible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993, Los Angeles chiropractor Dr. Eric Pearl started having unusual&nbsp;experiences with his patients that quickly got more bizarre. At first, they could feel his hands before he touched them but more importantly, their aches and pains started vanishing. Over the next couple of years, Pearl&rsquo;s ability developed to the point where people who had been told &lsquo;nothing can be done&rsquo; by the medical profession&rsquo;s top doctors were being healed from severely debilitating conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was happening? It took Pearl a while to work it out and he had some strange experiences along the way, which he describes in his book, The Reconnection, Heal Others, Heal Yourself, (for example, light beings appearing at the end of his bed) but now his conclusion is that he was suddenly able to access frequencies of light, information and energy that had never before been present on Earth. He says these healing frequencies are able to bring the human body back into a state of balance. As a result, imbalances that manifest as disease and illness simply vibrate out of the body. He calls it, &ldquo;a new level of healing that many believe may be here on the planet for the very first time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pearl says he doesn&rsquo;t create or direct these new energies, he simply receives and allows them, not unlike a lightning rod or metal conductor. More importantly, he believes everyone of us can learn to do it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the cold light of day, such claims could be dismissed as the rants of a crazy man but the countless anecdotal reports are not so easily dismissed. Pearl&rsquo;s work is making waves across the world, he travels tirelessly, teaching thousands of people how to access and use these healing frequencies. He&rsquo;s appeared on US TV show Dr. Oz and been invited to speak at the United Nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamara Pitelen spoke to Dr. Pearl via Skype in November 2014. The following is an edited version of that interview. To watch the video interview, go to the Awakenings TV YouTube channel or Awakenings Facebook page at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/reconnective-healing/www.facebook.com/Awakeningsme\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/Awakeningsme</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Eric 1 702 x 526\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eric-1-702-x-526-450x337.jpg\" style=\"height:337px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Eric Pearl, Founder of Reconnective Healing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE FUTURE OF HEALING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TP: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that you do not direct the healing frequencies that you receive; that they go wherever in the body they are needed of their own accord. So does this mean these energies have an intelligence?&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EP: &ldquo;They are an intelligence. It&rsquo;s not that they have an intelligence; they ARE an intelligence. There is a field of intelligence. Something tells trees to grow up and roots to grow down, and for children to be born with two eyes and one nose. We give it names but there is a field of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Lets go back a bit. Our bodies don&rsquo;t heal the way we were taught. We were taught our bodies healed through biochemicals but we know today that the biochemical model is obsolete. Our bodies heal through energy, frequency, vibration; a vibratory entrainment with one another, it&rsquo;s communicated via light. &ldquo;We know that our very&nbsp;DNA emits levels of light; that the concept that we are light is not just<br />\r\na metaphysical spiritual concept&nbsp;any longer, we know today from the work of Dr Fritz Albert-Popp (1) in Germany and others that we emit light and when that light is measurably dimming, our health is diminishing and when the light comes back, our health comes back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s one. Point two, our brains don&rsquo;t work the way we were taught. If you remember the old professor who pulls out a chart of&nbsp;the brain with circles showing the different areas, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s speech, here&rsquo;s memory, here&rsquo;s this, here&rsquo;s that&hellip;&rsquo; but that model is also dead and obsolete. We now know that the information within our brains is not held in little sequestered areas but is diffused throughout the brain and we&rsquo;re beginning to understand that it&rsquo;s not within the brain; that it exists within a field of information that science today calls the zero point field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Back in the 1800s we used to call it the etheric field.&nbsp;So people who are geniuses,&nbsp;people who are psychics, people who are healers, it&rsquo;s no big secret, they&rsquo;re just listening a little more to the field and they&rsquo;re not second-guessing the information, therefore they&rsquo;re allowing it to flow through.&nbsp;There are two types of listening.&nbsp;One type of listening &ndash; I&rsquo;m not talking about just with the ears now &ndash; is a type of awareness. We live in what we perceive as a four dimensional universe and&nbsp;we listen passively, we listen with four dimensions but active listening allows&nbsp;us to become more aware of the field itself, when we listen actively we can shift a little bit, sometimes the head tilts, sometimes the eyes fall to the side and we go somewhere beyond the limitations of the four dimensions, we exist in a timelessness, this is our nature and this is what I believe we are here to discover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we interact with the Reconnective Healing spectrum of energy, light and information, we simply feel, we become aware, we don&rsquo;t do anything, we listen more actively, we feel this and as we do, we vibrate at that level and as we interact with the person we&rsquo;re working with, something inside of them wakes up to that awareness, and they say, &lsquo;hey this is me vibrating healthy, this is me vibrating naturally, I think I&rsquo;ll do it again&rsquo; and as they return&nbsp;to that level of vibration and light, the densities in their field including health challenges as well as mental, emotion, spiritual, relationship, career challenges, fall away as is appropriate for that person. We don&rsquo;t force the healing,&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t create or say &lsquo;this will be the healing that will happen&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s right for that person. Healing isn&rsquo;t about treating symptoms; healing is about allowing a person to vibrate at a higher state of balance, a higher state of light and as they return to their level of their vibration at that light, then their imbalances pretty much fall away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TP: Are there any conditions you haven&rsquo;t been able to heal with RH?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EP: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the point where&nbsp;I recognise that nothing is beyond the&nbsp;reach of Reconnective Healing. I&rsquo;ve seen holes in people&rsquo;s bodies the size of a pencil eraser completely heal overnight like it had never been there even though it&rsquo;d been there for nine or 10 years. I&rsquo;ve seen people with surgical pins in their arms that couldn&rsquo;t raise their arm and within an instant, have full range of motion. There is nothing that this is beyond&nbsp;the reach of this but we have to realise again that it&rsquo;s not the health challenge that has the healing, it&rsquo;s the individual. Therefore, three people can come to see you once you learn this work, with the same diagnosis and the same symptoms but they might receive three different&nbsp;sets of results depending on what was appropriate for each of those people on their life course at that moment.&nbsp;Some of us may choose our illnesses to get love. We often think about people going through a specific illness or health challenge for their lessons but we don&rsquo;t always stop&nbsp;and think that they may very well&nbsp;have made that selection as well for&nbsp;the lessons of those close to them, their families, their caretakers, their children. There are so many intricacies.&nbsp;If you learn this work on a professional level, when people make&nbsp;an appointment, you tell them the truth from the beginning. &lsquo;Just like with a medical doctor, I can&rsquo;t tell you if your healing will happen 100, 50 or 25 per cent. Whether it&rsquo;ll happen right away, whether it&rsquo;ll happen later, whether you&rsquo;ll even notice anything at all. All I can tell you is that, unlike your medical doctor, I can promise you that you won&rsquo;t get worse from this so if that&rsquo;s alright with you I&rsquo;m happy to schedule you in for an appointment 2.15pm on Thursday&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Reference:</strong>&nbsp;German physicist Dr. Albert-Popp has conducted research that confirms the existence of biophotons; particles of light, with no mass, transmit information within and between cells. His work shows that DNA in a living cell stores and releases photons creating &ldquo;biophotonic emissions&rdquo; that may hold the key to illness and health.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RECONNECTIVE HEALING QUICK Q&amp;A</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Answers in brief from Dr. Eric Pearl to some of the burning questions about Reconnective Healing&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why have you stopped personally healing others?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EP: &ldquo;When I was doing healing sessions, no one would go to anyone else because they thought I was the best so it became my responsibility to take myself off the market so people realise they are going to have to go to someone else to learn this work and in that there is the empowerment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you heal yourself daily, weekly&hellip;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EP: &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not about a dependency. You don&rsquo;t need to have healing after healing after healing&hellip; I do like to allow myself&nbsp;to drift off at night sometimes and feel the frequencies that vibrate, I have that vibratory feeling, float off, it&rsquo;s like bathing in the healing frequencies but it&rsquo;s a different consciousness from &lsquo;now I&rsquo;m going to do a self-healing&rsquo;. On the truest level, healing is not just for regaining use of your arm or leg or liver or vision&hellip; healing is, I believe, the next level of human evolution.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You say you&rsquo;re here to bring through light, energy and information that have not previously been available on the planet. Who has given them to us?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EP: &ldquo;Who is giving them? Who is giving everything? God. Love. The intelligence of the universe&hellip; by whatever name we choose to call that but part of that is that as time is expanding, this is part of our growth, our human experience, to allow us to better understand the universal, spiritual beings of love that we are inside.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are all RH practitioners equally able?</strong><br />\r\nEP: &ldquo;When people ask, &lsquo;how can I find the best Reconnective Healing practitioners, the ones who are pulling it through the fullest and most powerfully?&rsquo; The only thing I can tell you is that, like a straw, every straw will bring the drink through equally well to the degree that the straw isn&rsquo;t clogged. Therefore look at the websites of the people doing Reconnective Healing. If they&rsquo;re doing it as well as doing this technique and that technique, then they are reducing it. You need to go to someone who has stepped into the self-secure position, the understanding of saying, &lsquo;I am now more than abundantly enough to release techniques.&rsquo; Go to someone who has left their techniques behind because they are really truly bringing through the higher stuff.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did you need special permissions to offer Reconnective Healing in the UAE?</strong><br />\r\nEP: &ldquo;I know a lot of good and important people there [in&nbsp;the UAE], which is nice. So all of those things have been worked out and handled by my office. I believe that the consciousness is expanding, I know it is from the people that I&rsquo;ve spoken to in higher positions there, they&rsquo;re excited to bring this forward. You have an amazing Government with phenomenal people in it who want to bring this change and I am honoured to be invited.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT AT A RECONNECTIVE&nbsp;HEALING SEMINAR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2015, Dr. Eric Pearl and his team are in Dubai to hold the first ever Reconnective Healing seminars in the Middle East. Here&rsquo;s what you can expect if you attend the two or four day seminars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The opening night of the seminar, I&rsquo;ll give a three hour presentation and talk about the history and the science and we&rsquo;ll bring up volunteers for healings, we&rsquo;ll let you feel this energy in the hands and we&rsquo;ll teach you to work with it. The next two days is when we&rsquo;ll teach you to do this on a personal level for yourself and loved ones. You&rsquo;ll stand at the head of a massage table and the teaching assistants and I will take your hands and we&rsquo;ll show you how to feel and find these frequencies and how to play with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you do, you&rsquo;ll start to witness with your own eyes, the person on that table, their fingers start to go into involuntary movement or their arm will jump, the leg will kick, you&rsquo;ll see their eyes dart back and forth, their colouring and breathing changes and then you&rsquo;ll swap places to experience it for yourself and they get to practice it on you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first couple of days doesn&rsquo;t make you a professional. It&rsquo;s the final two days when we teach you nuances and how&nbsp;to enhance it. There is an interaction with these frequencies that entrains you to vibrate at that level. It&rsquo;s an activation in a sense, although I hate to sound Star Trekky about it. You&rsquo;re like a teabag steeping in a pot. There&rsquo;s a transformation that takes place within you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To book on the two or four day Reconnective Healing workshops, go to www.TheReconnection.com.

(43, 'Tried and Tested: Cranio-sacral Therapy', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>A gentle healing modality used to balance the central nervous system to deal with mental and physical conditions as diverse as headaches, depression and sports injuries.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the upshot is that years of ongoing stress have left me with decreased spinal mobility resulting in spinal rigidity; an erratic nervous system; areas where my cranio-sacral fluid is congested, as well as hyper-toned musculature, primarily around my mid-thoracic spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s the diagnosis of Shivani Sarsthi, a Physical Therapist based out of Vancouver, Canada, who specialises in cranio-sacral therapy. Her clinical practise is at Breath and Health Alternative Medical Center in Dubai. Cranio-sacral therapy is a non-invasive approach to healing that deals with conditions under the umbrella of mental or physical health, from headaches to depression to sports injuries &ndash; under the premise that so much of what ails us has its root in the nervous system; the result of stress or anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE is rife with stress-related issues, Sarsthi says. &ldquo;You get a lot of Type A personalities, everyone is super-busy, rushing about from one thing to the next until the stressed state becomes normal, which leads to health deterioration until &lsquo;suddenly&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a chronic health issue, anything from Irritable Bowel Syndrome to tendonitis, hip and back pain&hellip; all resulting from stress.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DEEP HEALING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve just had an hour-long session with Sarsthi, it was my first experience of cranio-sacral therapy (CST). It&rsquo;s a little like having a massage in that you lie on a table in your underwear covered by a towel but instead of being rubbed and kneaded all over your body, she uses a very gentle pressure on just the feet, head, neck and shoulders. In particular she works on the base of the skull and the spine. The therapist&rsquo;s movements are slow and light. It is amazingly relaxing and feels absolutely wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A trained massage therapist and Reiki healer, Sarsthi has been treating clients with CST for about five years. Before that, she used a more traditional orthopaedic approach to healing. For example, if someone came in with shoulder pain, she would treat the shoulder. The frustration, she says, is that healing was often not lasting; the pain would return because the root cause of the problem was not being addressed. This is the crucial difference with cranio-sacral therapy, she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re treating the root of the problem with cranio-sacral therapy because when you focus on the nervous system, it&rsquo;s a deeper kind of healing from inside out.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of healing also comes down to something as simple as sleep, Sarsthi says. Most people who are experiencing pain are not getting into the deepest sleep cycles, which are the only states in which tissue healing takes place. CST helps here as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RHYTHM AND FLOW</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting back to me though. How could Sarsthi tell that I&rsquo;ve got stress-related issues just by holding my head and feeling around my spine? She says that she tunes into the pulses and rhythm, the ebb and flow of the cranial-sacral fluid &ndash; this is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. According to the website of the UK Cranial Sacral Therapy Association, the practitioner &ldquo;senses tensions in the body and helps to release them in a supported and comfortable way. During or after a session you may feel calm and energised with increased clarity of mind and a feeling of well-being.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarsthi says she goes into almost a meditative state and feels for the movement and rhythms of the fluid, in a similar way to how a doctor might feel for a pulse to assess blood pressure. She says the rhythm of the cranio-sacral fluid can give her remarkable insights into the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After doing this for a few years now, I find I can often tell what&rsquo;s going on in a person&rsquo;s life, for example if they&rsquo;re going through a difficult time. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m psychic but in this meditative state you get very sensitive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, Sarsthi says she is facilitating the body to heal itself. This includes teaching the body what it feels like to be relaxed. Some of her clients are ADHD children and parents have given very positive feedback regarding changes in their children&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rewarding, there&rsquo;s no other profession in the world I&rsquo;d rather be doing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Shivani Sarsthi&nbsp;</em></strong><em>practises cranio-sacral therapy at Breath and Health Alternative Medical Centre at 1080, Al Wasl Road,<br />\r\nUmm Suquim 2, Jumeirah,<br />\r\nDubai.

This process accesses your subconscious and gives the therapist clues about what you need for mind and body balance. The vibration of the colours chosen, as well as their corresponding aromas, match the vibration of your body and emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first colour picked indicates what you need at that moment; the second colour reveals your deeper wellness need while the third colour shows what will help achieve that. The final colour indicates your future direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evangeline had my file notes and, spookily, the last time I had a colour consultation at Spadunya was the exact same date and month two years earlier. More spookily, the first three colours I chose were exactly the same as two years earlier, namely green, turquoise, and blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This shows you still really need more peace and serenity in your life,&rdquo; said Evangeline, which is what turquoise and blue represent. Armed with this information about my mental and emotional state, Evangeline incorporated my chosen colours into the massage and facial treatment through the addition of scents and serums into the massage oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRANSCENDENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next 90 minutes or so were a transcendent blur of, yes, I&rsquo;m going to say it&hellip; bliss. You can always tell when a massage therapist really knows what they&rsquo;re doing. A masseuse or masseur who understands the way muscles attach to joints and bones as well as how to manipulate the different directions and textures of muscle fibre is worlds apart from one who just rubs your body without any real idea of body and mind health. Evangeline knew what she was doing; she found the knots in my muscles and gently worked them out. I could almost hear my body purring beneath her skillful fingers particularly when she worked on my head and neck. There is something incredibly pleasurable about someone doing something as simple as holding the weight of your head and gently stretching your cervical spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came the mini-facial using organic oils and serums such as the Fleur de Bach anti-stress cleanser, scrub and mask together with Altearah Bio serums for facial massage. The process involves hot towels to open pores before cleansing, scrubbing, a mask and moisturisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gentle pressure of the massage along with essential oils applied on reflex points improves blood circulation and leaves you with a glowing complexion and relaxed body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All up, it left me feeling amazing and rejuvenated. As well, I thought I looked a hundred times better walking out of Spadunya than I had when I walked in a couple of hours earlier thanks to brighter eyes and tighter, smoother skin. To keep a more peaceful frame of mind, I bought a bottle of the turquoise Altearah Bio perfume to spray into my palms and inhale every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Colour Harmonising Holistic Experience</em></strong><em>&nbsp;is a signature treatment at Spadunya Club.

(45, 'Mindfulness meditation as medication', 'body', 'eco & lifestyle', 'meditation', '', '', '<p><strong><em>Even most traditional doctors in the UK now believe their patients could improve their health with meditation. Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D. Griffiths of the Psychological Wellbeing and Metal Health Research Unit of the UK&rsquo;s Nottingham Trent University report on meditation as medication.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recently, it was practically unheard of that doctors and other front-line health professionals would even consider prescribing their patients&rsquo; meditation rather than medication. However, according to a report by the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mental Health Foundation,&nbsp;</em>72 per cent of general practitioners in the UK now believe that patients can improve their health by practising meditation. The most popular meditation technique to be used in research and healthcare settings is mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is the practice of cultivating a full and open awareness of the present moment. Research has shown that we have a tendency to not be &lsquo;fully present&rsquo; and this can sometimes leave us feeling that life is racing by too fast. If we spend most of our time dwelling on the past and/or trying to rush towards the future, then we miss out on what is happening &lsquo;here and now&rsquo;. Given that the past is history, and the future is fantasy, the present moment is the only place where we can truly experience and appreciate the wonders of life. So how do we introduce mindfulness into our daily lives and make sure that we stay in touch with the present moment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mindfulness explained</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindfulness has been used by Buddhist practitioners for over 2,500 years. Although you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that &lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo; means that we should be &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo;, this doesn&rsquo;t quite capture the essence of mindfulness practice. Being &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo; basically means that there is a lot of mental exertion (as well as a lot of brain noise and chatter). Having a &lsquo;full up&rsquo; mind all of the time can be stressful and tiring and it doesn&rsquo;t leave room for wholesome thoughts to grow and flourish. Mindfulness helps to create space in the mind so that we can observe and nourish our being more fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life is an extraordinarily rare and fragile gift. If we are fortunate, it may last for 100 years. Each and every moment contained within those 100 years is profoundly unique. Nobody else will experience that moment and it will never arise again. It was born, it lived, and it died &ndash; gone forever. If we are not fully aware of all that we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch in each and every moment then maybe we have to conclude that we are not fully alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pali word for mindfulness is&nbsp;&lsquo;<em>sati&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>which means &lsquo;<em>to remember</em>&rsquo; &ndash; in the sense that we should remember to be aware of all that we experience in the present moment. Given the present moment is made up of countless happenings and occurrences, the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness outline four key areas that can be used as focus points for our concentration: (i) the body (starting with the breath), (ii) feelings, (iii) thoughts and mental processes, and (iv) the environment around us. Basically then, the best way to practice mindfulness is to start by becoming aware of our breathing, then expand our meditative awareness to encompass the body, then feelings and thoughts, and finally the environment in which we find ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The health benefits of mindfulness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research studies have shown that over 80 per cent of British adults believe that modern-day pressured lifestyles lead to stress and illness and that their health can be improved by slowing down and learning to be mindful of the present moment. According to the latest research findings, mindfulness meditation can be beneficial for improving a wide variety of health conditions including stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, eating disorders, and even problems relating to sexual performance. In fact, some forms of mindfulness meditation are now recommended by the&nbsp;<em>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&nbsp;</em>for the treatment of specific types of depression. In addition to its medical benefits, scientific research has also shown that mindfulness can improve intellectual functioning and memory capacity &ndash; including in school-age children. Engaging in mindfulness regularly has also been shown to improve people&rsquo;s spiritual wellbeing as well as their overall sense of purpose in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five tips for practising mindfulness effectively</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Adopt a suitable meditation posture</em>: The first thing to think about when starting to practice mindfulness meditation is to adopt a suitable meditation posture. The most important things to keep in mind are that your posture is stable and that you are comfortable (because a good physical posture leads to a good mental posture). Some people prefer to sit cross-legged on a meditation cushion whilst others prefer sitting upright on a chair. It&rsquo;s simply a matter of personal preference &ndash; either position can work well. In an eight-week group mindfulness program we developed called Meditation Awareness Training (MAT), the analogy of a mountain is used to help participants understand the most appropriate posture for meditation. A mountain has a definite presence, it is upright and stable, yet at the same time it is without tension and does not have to strain to maintain its posture &ndash; it is relaxed, content, and deeply-rooted in the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Follow the breath</em>: As part of mindfulness practice, observing the breath is used as a kind of &lsquo;meditative anchor&rsquo; to help with concentration and with maintaining an open-awareness of the present moment. Being fully aware of the in-breath and out-breath helps to &lsquo;tie the mind&rsquo; to the present moment and to slow down our thought processes. If you&rsquo;re somebody who has difficulty concentrating, then try counting the breath from one to ten, and then back to one. Similarly, you might find it helpful to quietly guide yourself with phrases such as &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am fully aware of my in-breath; breathing out, I am fully aware of my out-breath</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am here; breathing out, I am now</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>breathing in, there is nowhere I need to be; breathing out, I am already home</em>&rdquo;. One thing to remember when following the breath during meditation is that it is very important not to force your breathing &ndash; just let the breath follow its natural course and allow it to calm and deepen on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Carry your meditation cushion with you</em>: Just as conditions such as the sun, rain, and nutrients are required for a seed to grow into a blossoming flower, meditative development requires us to make the &lsquo;right effort&rsquo; at all times. Sometimes people try to cram in their mindfulness practice with all of the other activities of their lives and they make the excuse that they don&rsquo;t have time to practice. However, this approach often leads to a stressful attitude towards mindfulness and for some people the practice can quickly start to become a chore. Therefore, the trick is to not create a separation between your mindfulness practice and the rest of your life. In fact, it&rsquo;s when you blow out your candles and stand up from your meditation cushion (or chair) that the practice of mindfulness really begins. While sitting or writing at the computer, tidying-up at home, cooking the dinner, or doing the weekly food shop, do your best to be mindful and to remember to observe your breathing. Real meditators are those who can practice &lsquo;on the job&rsquo; and this is why some meditation teachers tell their students to carry their meditation cushions with them at all times. Try not to battle with yourself &ndash; make the present moment your home and simply bring your awareness to whatever you are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Make use of mindfulness reminders</em>: Based on our own experience of teaching and researching MAT, those that best manage to integrate their mindfulness practice into everyday life tend to be the ones who show the greatest improvements in overall levels of psychological and spiritual wellbeing. One helpful way of maintaining mindfulness during everyday activities is to use &lsquo;<em>mindfulness reminders</em>&rsquo;. An example of a mindfulness reminder is an hour chime (e.g., from a wrist-watch or desktop computer), that, upon sounding, can be used as a trigger to gently bring the mind back to the present moment and to the natural flow of the in-breath and out-breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Have realistic expectations and keep practicing:</em>&nbsp;Finally &ndash; as with many things in life &ndash; it is not uncommon for people to begin practising mindfulness enthusiastically, but then give up as soon as a minor difficulty is encountered. One reason why some people don&rsquo;t stick at their practice is because they have unrealistic expectations. Mindfulness is not a quick-fix solution. Long-lasting spiritual and personal growth require perseverance and a great deal of practice. Thinking that mindfulness meditation can immediately solve all of your problems or change your life overnight is a mistake. However, just as all effects follow a cause, the day-in day-out integrating of all aspects of your life with present-moment awareness will gradually begin to soften the conditioned mind and &ndash; over time &ndash; allow rays of tranquillity and insight to slowly break through. When correctly practiced, mindfulness is extremely hard work and requires us to be patient and compassionate with ourselves. However, mindfulness also requires us to thoroughly enjoy life no matter what situation we find ourselves in. The practice of accepting and getting to know our mind and true selves during mindfulness meditation &ndash; including those parts of our character that we&rsquo;d sometimes prefer didn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; can be really hard work, but it should also be a lot of fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The authors of this article are Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D.

It&rsquo;s a technique for achieving healing states of consciousness. Still don&rsquo;t understand? Read this first-hand account of a Holotropic Breathwork journey by Alexandra Salkova McKenzie.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I was running through a deep forest. Everything seemed dim and dark but I felt joy. Joy from running, moving and the scents of the forest. In that moment, my consciousness moved inward and to my surprise, I realised I was a huge, black shaggy wolf&hellip;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is crazy!&rdquo; I thought to myself but in my years as a student of psychology and a practitioner of various healing therapies, I&rsquo;ve witnessed enough extraordinary experiences to know that it&rsquo;s best to put my intellect to the side so &ndash; with curiosity and apprehension &ndash; I allowed this experience to unfold in front of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The wolf run out of the forest and stood next to a village made of teepees. People were gathered around a fire. Then the music changed into a tribal song and all the villagers &ndash; as if they also heard the loud music &ndash; started to dance around the fire. The loud music set the tone and I was breathing in rhythm with the dancers and the observing wolf.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t differentiate who I was; as if I was the music, the villagers, the forest and the wolf. But at some level I also knew I was in a room with my fellow Holotropic breathers, all of us on a day-long workshop of self-exploration..</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT IS HOLOTROPIC BREATHWORK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by psychiatrist Stan Grof and psychotherapist Christina Grof, Holotropic Breathwork is a practice that uses breathing and other elements to allow access to non-ordinary states for the purpose of self-exploration and healing. It combines the power of breathing, the therapeutic potential of music, chanting, bodywork and mandala drawing, in order to achieve non-ordinary, healing states of consciousness. All of these techniques have been used for centuries in the sacred practices of ancient and native cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually done in groups, people work in pairs and alternate in the roles of experiencer (&lsquo;breather&rsquo;) and &lsquo;sitter&rsquo;. The sitter&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to focus compassionate attention on the breather. Secondarily, the sitter is available to assist the breather, but not to interfere or interrupt the process. Facilitators are also on hand to help if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Holotropic Breathwork website (<a href=\"http://www.holotropic.com/\">www.holotropic.com</a>): &ldquo;With the eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual&rsquo;s psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practitioners can relive any stage of their own history or enter the realms of archetypes, animals, birth and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANGELS AND DEMONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Being the wolf and observing the villagers made me aware of my journey. Somehow, I knew, when I grow spiritually, I will become a black panther. In that instance, the wolf morphed into a black panther. The strength and solid power run through my veins. Music changed and I noticed the villagers could not see me anymore. I stood facing a dark corner of the forest.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A loud cry from one of my fellow breathers caught my attention. The girl screamed with fear, and her loud shriek penetrated my panther experience. The analytical, logical mind guarding my visions pointed out that she must be scared of something.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In that very instant I noticed that I am not scared of anything. In fact, as if I could reach the girl&rsquo;s fear and feel it too, but I wasn&rsquo;t scared. The panther, me, realised my power and strength and I felt fearless instead.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The challenge of being fearless seemed exciting. I looked into the darkness and called: &ldquo;Bring the fear, I am ready to feel the fear!&rdquo; The fear came out creeping as a dark fog from the forest, brushed off my coat and disappeared. It left me flabbergasted. &ldquo;Am I truly fearless?&rdquo; I started to search for the fear &ndash; I felt excitement, as if I was playing a game of emotions.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In that moment, the music changed and I shifted from the black panther into a beautiful angel floating high in the sky.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my experience unfolded, my consciousness morphed into an angel floating above humanity. I understood human emotions from a much higher vantage point. Interestingly, Grof states that probably the most profound experience available in holotropic states is identification with the Supracosmic and Metacosmic Void (Sanskrit&nbsp;<em>sunyata</em>), primordial Emptiness and Nothingness that is conscious itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I watched the wars across lands and thousand of humans fighting for a cause. Tremendous sadness and despair was hovering above humanity across time. Looking down at humanity, I understood&hellip; I experienced absolute nothingness of emotions; the emptiness, which was vast and sweet, and I became aware of much deeper meaning of existence.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The music changed and the harmonic tones brought me into another scene. I was one of a group of riders on beautiful white horses galloping, as if nearly flying</em><em>,</em><em>&nbsp;through the countryside.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this moment I became tired.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and released my sitter from his duties. I felt the experience was pretty much finished although the two and half hours had felt like minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIFT OF FEARLESSNESS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a Holotropic Breathwork session, participants express their experiences through painting mandalas. At the end of my session, I was unable to speak for a while, integrating my experiences. I painted my mandala in silence and took my time to assimilate everything. I realised that the feeling of fearlessness, detaching from emotions, seeing a bigger picture behind life and living fearlessly was a true gift. I recalled Anita Moorjani&rsquo;s recent book&nbsp;<em>Dying to be me</em>&nbsp;where she described &ldquo;being fearless&rdquo; as one of the most important steps in reaching a fulfilled life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through my professional practice, I am aware of the wisdom of our psyche and Holotropic Breathwork&rsquo;s vision further supports that it is not the healer or the therapist who is wise, but the psyche of the individual whose wisdom is tended and brought to flower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Swiss psychiatrist Carl G. Jung (1875-1961), the psyche is not a product of the brain and it is not contained in the skull; it is the creative and generative principle of the cosmos (anima mundi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, French Jesuit priest and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) said, &ldquo;We are not human beings having spiritual experiences, we are spiritual beings having human experiences.&rdquo; [Source:&nbsp;<em>Le Ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne Humain</em>, 1955]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holotropic Breathwork is recommended to anyone who is on a journey of self-discovery. Some sessions may not be a walk in the park however every lesson we take is another step on our way to true self.&nbsp; Ultimately, every part of our existence, even personal growth cannot be learnt, it has to be experienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Alexandra Salkova McKenzie of Inner Self Consultancy is a certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, NLP Master and Coach, EFT/EET, Reiki and ThetaHealing Practitioner and Ham-Sa Yogini.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>She provides private coaching for those seeking change, growth and health as well as meditation classes and workshops.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tel 050 698 46 12 or email:</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:alexandra@innerselfconsultancy.com\">alexandra@innerselfconsultancy.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.innerselfconsultancy.com/\">www.innerselfconsultancy.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Holotropic Breathwork UAE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keen to try Holotropic Breathwork?

By Neha Jamani.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very word &lsquo;cancer&rsquo; strikes fear and panic into the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In allopathic medicine, its diagnosis offers only one option for treatment and survival: a punishing regime of radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. In the world of alternative healing though, there are other approaches to treating cancer and chronic degenerative diseases, one of which is The Gerson Therapy. It&rsquo;s not easy though. As well as following a hyper strict vegan, plant-based, no salt and virtually fat-free diet, people on the therapy also have to make thirteen fresh juices a day and give themselves four coffee enemas a day &ndash; and they have to do this religiously for 18 months to three years, depending on the type of cancer and its severity. Not so much as a grain of white sugar or white flour can pass your lips. For some, chemotherapy seems easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT IS GERSON THERAPY?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Created by German physician Dr. Max Gerson in the 1930s, The Gerson Therapy is a detoxification and nutrition programme that strengthens the immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Germany in 1881, Dr. Gerson initially developed the therapy as a treatment for his own debilitating migraines and eventually as a treatment for chronic degenerative diseases such as skin tuberculosis, diabetes and &mdash; most famously &mdash; cancer. Dr. Gerson believed that toxicity and nutritional deficiency were the two factors in the onset of cancer. The Gerson programme seeks to address the underlying systemic causes of cancer and activate the body&rsquo;s ability to heal itself. &nbsp; His youngest daughter Charlotte, now age 92, energetically continues his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what sets the Gerson Therapy apart from conventional cancer treatments. A metabolic therapy, it is based on the theory that disease is caused by the body&rsquo;s accumulation of toxic substances. Metabolic therapy uses a combination of special diets, enzymes, nutritional supplements, and other measures to remove &lsquo;toxins&rsquo; from the body and strengthen the body&rsquo;s defenses against disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gerson Therapy is a natural treatment that activates the body&rsquo;s extraordinary ability to heal itself through a strictly organic vegetarian diet, raw juices, coffee enemas, and natural supplements.&nbsp; The powerful natural treatment boasts the body&rsquo;s immune system to heal cancer, arthritis, heart disease, allergies and many other degenerative diseases. With a whole body approach to healing, the Gerson programme aims to restore the internal terrain and fully utilise the body&rsquo;s amazing self-healing ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HOW GERSON THERAPY WORKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With generous, high-quality nutrition, increased oxygen availability, detoxification, and improved metabolism, the cells &ndash; and the body &ndash; can regenerate, become healthy and prevent future illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gerson Therapy is a finely-tuned precision instrument, where every component plays an important role and affects all other parts. It must be practiced in its entirety without omitting a single detail or the overall therapy cannot work to its potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOOD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food processing adds more sodium to the foods we eat, which changes the metabolism of the cells in the body, eventually causing cancer.&nbsp; According to practitioners of the Gerson Therapy, people who have cancer have too much sodium and not enough potassium in their cells.&nbsp; The Gerson diet starts out as a strict low-salt vegan diet excluding animal products and oils (except for flax seed oil).&nbsp; After four weeks, the diet evolves to include a small amount of protein.&nbsp;Nuts and seeds are initially excluded as they are too high in oils, but they are reintroduced later on.&nbsp; Vegetable proteins such as lentils or rice are also gradually introduced back into the diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JUICES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freshly-made organic juices are one of the most important healing components in the Gerson programme. Juicing allows the body to easily digest and absorb nutrients and enzymes, so the programme consists of a large volume of fresh juices.&nbsp; Apple and carrot juice, green juice and citrus juice are consumed throughout the day by patients on the Gerson programme.&nbsp; Depending on the protocol, sometimes juices are consumed hourly up to 13 times per day. Green juices, in particular, contain high amounts of chlorophyll, which releases oxygen and promotes higher oxygen availability for the body.&nbsp; The Gerson protocol requires a special two-step juicer or masticating juicer with a separate hydraulic press. The two-step process is best suited for the Gerson protocol because it helps extract more minerals and essential nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MEDICATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All medication used in connection with the Gerson therapy are classified as biological materials of organic origin that are supplied in therapeutic amounts. These medications are nutritional supplements consisting of natural substances present in and needed for the normal functioning of various body systems. Some of the supplements used in the programme &ndash; such as potassium and lugol &mdash; are added to the juices. Others, including CoQ10, liver extract, pancreatic enzymes, B-12, thyroid hormone, niacin, and flax seed oil &ndash; are taken orally with juices and food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DETOXIFICATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combined effect if the food, juices and medication causes the immune system to attack and kill the tumor tissue.&nbsp; Detoxification is key to flushing out the accumulated toxins and preventing the risk of overburdening the liver. Coffee enemas are the primary method of detoxification of the tissues and blood on the Gerson Therapy.&nbsp; The amount of juice is matched to the number of coffee enemas (usually three to five daily), which are self-administered throughout the day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The coffee recommended for use in the enemas is a special lightly-roasted variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHY ISN&rsquo;T GERSON MAINSTREAM?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people may have heard of The Gerson Therapy, but many have not.&nbsp; This remains the case for most alternative cancer treatments. Mainstream cancer research centres feel that the available scientific evidence does not support claims that Gerson Therapy is effective in treating cancer.&nbsp; Furthermore, the principles behind it are not widely accepted by the scientific and medical communities yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gerson Institute, which certifies centres to administer the therapy, is a non-profit organisation whose research unit maintains an extensive collection of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gerson-research.org/docs/index.html\">reports documenting the research and science behind the Gerson Therapy</a>.&nbsp; The Institute also conducts and collects research on the role of diet on cancer and claims to have documented many success stories of people whose conventional doctors gave&nbsp;no hope for recovery, yet were able to overcome their disease against all odds using the Gerson programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DIY GERSON THERAPY&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless you check in to one of the licensed clinics in Tijuana, Mexico or near Budapest, Hungary, The Gerson Therapy is largely a do-it-yourself process, which means that you are solely in charge of administering your programme. Usually, there is no one to supervise you and make sure that you observe the rules faithfully.&nbsp; The Gerson Institute does not own or operate any medical facilities.&nbsp; Instead, it refers patients to the clinics that it licenses as properly administering the therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most alternative therapies, the Gerson Therapy is very expensive. If you are thinking of having Gerson therapy at home there are also costs involved. In addition to the initial cost of a special juicer and possibly a water filter, you have ongoing costs of the organic fruit and vegetables, coffee and supplements because this is no short-term fix. The therapy takes time.&nbsp; In his earlier research, Dr. Gerson specified being on the programme about 18 months. But with today&rsquo;s more toxic environment, practitioners are finding that patients need to be on the therapy for at least two years, and in many cases, three.&nbsp; Non-malignant diseases such as arthritis and lupus fall on the shorter end of that scale, while advanced cases of cancer fall closer to the three-year range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PERSONAL CHOICE&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the World Cancer Research Fund International, there were an estimated 14.1 million cancer cases around the world in 2012, of which 7.4 million cases were in men and 6.7 million in women. This number is expected to increase to 24 million by 2035. Of all diseases, cancer is undoubtedly the one that strikes the greatest fear into most hearts and minds. Its high prevalence in societies worldwide and its effects are devastating. The side effects of the treatments are harsh and the mortality rate is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is ultimately up to those who are faced with cancer to decide which treatment they want to undergo. The system is not a miracle cure for everyone, and even the Gerson Institute states that Gerson way of healing is neither a universal panacea nor a miracle cure.&nbsp; The Institute itself states that the therapy may fail for variety of reasons, or example, if the patient comes to the therapy too late, or commences the therapy after a full range of conventional treatments has failed to produce a remission, or if the patient doesn&rsquo;t observe the rules of the programme or if the patient has had an essential organ removed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such cases aside, according to the Gerson Institute&rsquo;s own research, the programme&rsquo;s success rate with advanced cancer, and many other serious degenerative diseases, far outstrips that of conventional treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The programme is demanding, intensive, prolonged and a far cry from the pill-popping &lsquo;instant&rsquo; ways of conventional treatments. But most conventional physicians offer only one route for cancer treatment &mdash; drugs, radiation and surgery &mdash; while ignoring or discounting alternative options such as the Gerson Therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more detailed information on this all-natural approach to treatment of chronic degenerative disease, please visit&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.thesacredkitchen.org/gerson\"><em>www.thesacredkitchen.org/gerson</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.gerson.org/\"><em>www.gerson.org</em></a><em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A therapeutic and holistic chef,&nbsp;<strong>Neha Jamani</strong>&nbsp;is founder of Dubai-based The Sacred Kitchen.

HOW (and why) TO GIVE YOURSELF A COFFEE ENEMA</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It&rsquo;s not the kind of thing one talks about in polite society but if the DIY approach to enemas appeals to you, here&rsquo;s one way to do it&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theory behind giving yourself a coffee enema is that it detoxifies the liver. The caffeine in the coffee is absorbed and sent straight to the liver where it becomes a strong detoxifier. It causes the liver to produce more bile, which moves toxins out towards the small intestine for elimination. This seems to free up the liver to process more incoming toxic materials that have accumulated in the organs, tissues and bloodstream. The coffee contains some alkaloids that also stimulate the production of glutathione-S-transferase, an enzyme used by the liver to make the detox pathways run. In other words, a coffee enema speeds up the detoxification process and minimises the backlog of yet to be detoxified substances. Sounds great but how do you actually do it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step one:</strong>&nbsp;In a stainless steel pot or glass plunger, add two flat tablespoons of organic coffee grounds to four cups (one litre) of boiled, distilled water. Some people pour the boiling water over the coffee grounds; while others boil the water and coffee together in a stainless steel pot for five minutes to release the oils. Either way, stir together and leave to cool to body or room temperature, this takes about half an hour. Do a finger test to judge temperature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step two:</strong>&nbsp;Take the cooled brewed coffee and, using a strainer to remove the grounds, pour the liquid into a jug. While waiting for the coffee liquid to cool, go the bathroom and prepare the bath tub &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be lying on your right side in the empty bath so you might want to put towels, blankets or cushions in the bottom of the tub for comfort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step three:</strong>&nbsp;To administer the enema you need a timer, some coconut oil or olive oil, the coffee liquid, an enema bag and hose, and a novel and music for relaxing. Pour half or all of the coffee liquid the enema bag and hang it up about one metre above you, for example, over the shower faucet. With the coconut oil, lubricate the nozzle of the hose and your anus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step four:</strong>&nbsp;Lay flat on your right side in the bathtub, insert the end of the hose, set your timer for 15 minutes and, when ready, unclamp the enema bag hose. First timers should only take small amounts of the liquid at a time &ndash; some days you will be able to hold the litre; other days you may not be able to take so much liquid so choose to repeat the procedure. If possible, hold the liquid within your intestines for 12 to 15 minutes but if you can&rsquo;t hold it for that long, remove the nozzle and get to the toilet. Expel and repeat the process until all the coffee liquid is gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Tips:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to use the bathtub, you can make a next of cushions and blankets in any room of the house (not too far from the toilet); you don&rsquo;t have to use coffee, you could use warm water, chamomile tea&hellip; check out&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\"><em>www.youtube.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;for many and varied ways to do a DIY enema.</em></p>\r\n', 'young-bald-woman-cancer-702x526-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:09:11'),
(48, 'Making scents: The Aromatherapy Effect', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p>Straight to the brain via the nose, the aroma of essential oils has a powerful effect on our psychological and physiological wellbeing. By Amber Gardner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holistic aromatherapy is the use of essential oils to improve physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential oils are the pure essences found in flowers, berries, grasses, roots, seeds, bark, fruits and herbs, which are extracted mainly by steam or water distillation. The process is similar to steaming vegetables as opposed to deep-frying them to preserve nutritional value. This methodology ensures that the healing essence and properties of that specific plant or botanic has been preserved as it is delicately concentrated into an essential oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All oils have their own unique character, aroma and therapeutic properties; as they are highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential oils hold many beneficial qualities on all levels of wellbeing yet their most distinct feature is their aroma. Aroma works on one of the most fascinating systems in our body; the limbic system, the most primal area of our brain that controls emotions, memories, motivation, sexual arousal, sleep patterns and hormones. The simple act of &lsquo;smelling&rsquo; activates these areas within the brain and affects us on physical, emotional and mental levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smelling an essential oil causes odour molecules to pass through the nose up into the brain, where it is then received by nerve receptors that trigger reactions in the body and mind. The limbic system is directly connected to hormone balance, breathing, blood pressure, memory, stress levels and heart rate. Thus explaining how and why essential oils hold such potent therapeutic qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each essential oil holds its own unique collection of properties that can range from lowering high blood pressure and easing toothaches to instilling a sense of relaxation and happiness. Moreover, the majority of essential oils hold antiseptic, antimicrobial and antiviral qualities, which are beneficial on the physical level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holistic aromatherapy is effective just by smelling the essential oils. Although often associated with massage, it is also a stand-alone practice. Essential oils hold potent qualities without needing the application of massage to be effective. They are successfully used in beauty products, simple topical self-application, diffused, used in a bath and much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AROMATHERAPY FOR YOU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though each essential oil holds its own unique range of therapeutic properties, the limbic system and its memory response have a greater effect on how we perceive scent. Every person responds to each essential oil differently. While lemon essential oil may uplift some people, it may trigger an opposing reaction in others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why the consultation process in holistic aromatherapy is crucial as one must take into account the physical, mental and emotional properties of essential oils as well as the reactions of each person to those oils and scents. Moreover, over time, a person&rsquo;s reactions to different scents will change as healing takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple example is how, in one person, the smell of lemon essential oil could trigger memories of citrusy lollipops from a happy childhood of summers spent at the beach while, for another person, the lemon scent could trigger a painful memory of being trapped in a cleaning cupboard. Consequently, these triggers affect us emotionally as we feel delighted or upset as well as physically as our body responds to the aroma and memory with a smile and relaxed muscles or with a cringe and tensed muscles. Hence, holistic aromatherapy works on the whole person for an array of emotional, mental and physical issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout history, essential oils and holistic aromatherapy have been used for both their therapeutic and aromatic properties. By design or by accident many people have found their lives were saved or their quality of life was increased through the use of essential oils. Many were revered for their mythical, magical, or religious healing abilities, all of which were made possible by the understanding of essential oils and their applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DIY AROMATHERAPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Three simple and easy home remedies to get you started&hellip;</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Pimple Exterminator</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>10ml Grapeseed Oil (high in Vitamin E and antioxidants)</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Lemon essential oil</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Tea Tree essential oil</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Lavender essential oil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Mix together and apply on desired areas overnight and watch your pimples disappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Sunburn Soother</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>30ml of Sesame Seed Oil or Almond Oil (Aloe Vera would also work wonderfully)</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Lavender essential oil</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Chamomile essential oil</li>\r\n	<li>5 drops of Bergamont essential oil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Mix them up and apply all over your body to soothe and cool affected areas.

They would create perfume cones out of fat and fragrant botanic oils then place them on their heads at public gatherings. The cones would melt in the heat, which would not only help with the foul-smelling crowds but the botanic properties from the oils would also protect them against disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oils were so much part of ancient Egyptian culture that around 48 BC when Julius Caesar returned to Rome with Cleopatra, there was a lavish parade where bottles of perfume where thrown into the crowds to symbolise Egyptian ways. Consequently the use of oils developed over thousands of years and spread throughout the world to the Romans, Hebrews, Assyrians and Babylonians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was studied by Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine, in 460-377 BC as well as by the Persian physician Ibn Sina, aka Avicenna, in 980-1037 AD. Ibn Sina was the first person to develop steam distillation and as a result produced rose oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Middle Ages, the Black Death, also known as the Bubonic Plague, wiped out millions of people across Europe, it was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history. Interestingly, workers in perfumeries and aromatics industries had a significantly lower infection rate, arguably due to the antiseptic and antiviral qualities of the oils they handled. Also, doctors of the time wore a &lsquo;plague mask&rsquo; a long-nosed, bird-like beak mask that was filled with dried flowers, herbs and spices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1910, French chemist Ren&eacute;-Maurice Gattefoss&eacute; worked in his family&rsquo;s perfumery business and sought out to study the medicinal properties of essential oils. During one of his experiments there was an explosion in his laboratory, which covered his hands in burning substances. He rinsed them in lavender oil and noted that the healing effects possibly saved his life. He went on to experiment on WWI soldiers in military hospitals. Gattefoss&eacute; is credited with coining the term &lsquo;aromatherapy&rsquo; in his 1937 book, &lsquo;Aromath&eacute;rapie: Les Huiles essentielles hormones vegetales&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977, the discoveries and recorded workings of Gattefoss&eacute; and others inspired Englishman Robert Tisserand to publish the first English book on the subject entitled, &lsquo;The Art of Aromatherapy&rsquo;. His book is now the go-to reference for any aspiring aromatherapy practitioner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Amber Gardner is a Dubai-based IFPA certified Holistic Aromatherapist.

(49, 'Interview with a water healer', 'body', 'healing', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Jessica Lang is a&nbsp;water healer. She was born with a &ldquo;healing gift&rdquo; that enables her to use the energy of water to heal illnesses ranging from cancer to depression and rheumatoid arthritis. That&rsquo;s the claim of Jessica and her clients, many of whom are so convinced that Jessica&rsquo;s gift has transformed or saved their lives that they have gone public to describe their experiences in her recently released book,&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Deo Volente</strong><em><strong>. During a visit to Dubai, Jessica spoke to Tamara Pitelen about her life and healing gift.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For five years, acute rheumatoid arthritis had made life increasingly difficult and painful for Dutch filmmaker Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her first symptoms appeared in 2005 but by 2006 her condition was chronic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, Hetty was in a wheelchair and could only drive a specially adapted car. By the time she had her first appointment with water healer Jessica Lang, she couldn&rsquo;t turn her head and all the joints in her wrists, arms and legs were painfully inflamed. Despite seeking out all kinds of traditional treatment, her condition continued to deteriorate. A colleague urged Hetty to visit Jessica so she made an appointment and that first session lasted nine hours. From that day on, her recovery was miraculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With Hetty,&rdquo; Jessica says, &ldquo;I saw a very big black ball of negativity in her back, the size of a basketball.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A water healing session with Jessica takes place in a bathroom because first the client is washed with specially prepared water and they must also drink this water in order to be cleansed inside and out to prepare for the healing work to come. (In case you&rsquo;re wondering, no, the client is not naked, they are either in clothes that they don&rsquo;t mind getting wet or in a bathing suit.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The water is just ordinary water from a tap but Jessica prepares it for the client. Water, she says, has its own intelligence and there is something about her, her energy, that facilitates the water to change its molecular structure in order to become whatever that particular client needs for healing. Sometimes this process takes a couple of minutes, sometimes a couple of hours but she always knows when the water is &ldquo;ready&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I am in contact with water, the water changes. The water becomes what the person coming to me needs it to be. Water lives; all water lives. Water is energy and I use the energy in the water.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE POWER OF WATER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Hetty, the water cleansing was followed by spiritual surgery to remove the black ball of negativity that was attached to her spine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I do an operation, I open the energetic body and pull out whatever needs to be removed. Hetty actually cried out when the ball was pulled out&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hetty. &ldquo;Even though I couldn&rsquo;t see what she was doing. I felt it in my whole spinal column; something releasing. And it felt like she was pulling something out of my lower back.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Hetty walks normally and is free of the condition that was crippling her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical healing session with Jessica lasts a minimum of four hours although it can go for much longer. Once, she treated someone for a total of 34 hours&hellip; non-stop. In that time, she did not even stop for food although there were toilet breaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because when I begin, I cannot stop. Time stands still for me, I am not occupied by human time when I am healing. I do not need to eat or drink or sleep and yet I feel energised.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING HANDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now aged 40, Jessica has had this &ldquo;healing gift&rdquo; for as long as she can remember. It took her a while to realise that she was able to see and feel things that other people could not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I was six, I walked into the kitchen to my mother. I knew she had a headache without her telling me. I said to her, &lsquo;I will take it&rsquo; and I put my hands on her head and it was gone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of years later, at age eight, Jessica remembers healing an aunt who couldn&rsquo;t walk properly, due to a lot of pain in her legs and knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She came to our house and I said, &lsquo;I see so much black in your knees, I can&rsquo;t take it out.&rdquo; So I did. The adults just humoured me because to them I was a child playing games but I could see black spaghetti in her knees and I could pull it out. I could see it and touch it like it was real. The same as anyone can pick up a pen from the table, I could reach out and touch this black substance. Then I said, &lsquo;I need to place my hands on your knees,&rsquo; so I sat there for a while, I don&rsquo;t know how long, with my hands on her knees until I said, &lsquo;ok, you can walk now, you will not have any pain,&rsquo; and I was annoyed that she just sat there because no one believed me, &lsquo;stop bothering your aunt&rsquo;, they said. She realised later though.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TO Z HEALING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jessica says she has not yet met someone she cannot help heal. Conditions from chronic physical diseases like cancer, heart disease and arthritis to mental illness such as depression, anxiety, anger, insomnia, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example, which is told in her recently released book entitled Deo Valente (&lsquo;God willing&rsquo; in Latin), is written by a woman who had a brain tumour when she came to see Jessica. The tumour was growing and causing her to black out and fall over several times a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I saw her, I knew the tumour was malignant,&rdquo; Jessica said. &ldquo;I removed it with spiritual surgery and an MRI scan a few weeks later showed it had shrunk. That was four years ago, she is now fine and symptom-free with no more black-outs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another client, who has also written about her healing with Jessica in Deo Volente, had a 20cm wound on her shin for four years that would not heal. She would have to rebandage it two to three times a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a session with Jessican, it healed in three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT IS NEGATIVITY?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Jessica, the source of all illness and dis-ease is negativity. This, of course, is a big word that covers a multitude of very different emotions and experiences; all of which come down to different vibrations of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every situation and experience in life has both positive and negative aspects. How a person chooses to view something reflects their inner world, Jessica says. &ldquo;Many people choose to focus on the negative, in this way you are asking for more negativity in your life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jessica Lang is based in The Netherlands but is an occasional visitor to Dubai. Her book, Deo Volente, comprises testimonials from 31 clients, who describe in their own words the healing they experienced with Jessica.

(50, 'Angel guidance', 'body', 'featured', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em>Do you believe in Angels?&nbsp;Angel guidance is available to every one, and is just one of the ways in which the Universe communicates its Divine Advice. Delna Anand explains.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of narrow escapes, close calls, out-of-the-blue meetings, and sudden career-defining ideas. What would you attribute this to? Good fortune? Fluke? Destiny? How about this &ndash; maybe there is someone who&rsquo;s actually looking out for you? An Angel, perhaps? Ok, so I may get a few raised eyebrows right now, but you&rsquo;d be surprised at the growing number of people in the world today who believe that we all are being guided and watched over by Angels. Angels are simply messengers of the Universe&rsquo;s infinite love and wisdom. The world is shifting and our old consciousness is slowly crumbling, making way for the new light to seep through. We are even beginning to hear from prominent people in the fields of science, medicine, philosophy and even business who say that there really is more consciousness to be accessed and to tune into than just our strict intellectual dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in this age of dramatic distraction however, we sometimes allow ourselves to get lost in the constant bombardment of emails, What&rsquo;sApp messages and social media notifications that scream for our attention. We dodge our ability to seek inner wisdom and divine guidance. Our thoughts constantly bestrew between a million things, leaving us no opportunity to create a deeper connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Angel guidance is available to every one, and is just one of the ways in which the Universe communicates its Divine Advice. Angels are peaceful, un-harming and forever willing to guide, assist and intercede, when asked. They are the common denominator in many faiths. Right from our childhood, we have believed in fairies, leprechauns and angels, at a time when our minds were free from judgment and ideologies. Angels are divine messengers that deliver guidance in all practices. So you needn&rsquo;t be fearful of seeking guidance from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most powerful messages they bring us is that we are never alone, help is always available and all we need to do is &ndash; ask! So if you feel stuck, or need to release a past issue, a negative repeating pattern with work, your finances, relationships or health, or if you are confused about a present cloudy situation, maybe its time to seek some angel love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are a few ways to do so &ndash; one is through yoga and meditation, and the other is through an Angel Card Reader. Like a scientist testing a hypothesis, take this experiment and see which one works for you. But in both methods, the key ingredient is &ndash; an open mind!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you have never meditated in your life, you could do so now, by sitting a place where you won&rsquo;t be disturbed for a few minutes, and close your eyes. When you want guidance, take a deep breath and on exhaling, make the sound &ldquo;HA&rdquo; as it opens the heart. With a couple of breaths, you can literally feel the heart and throat opening. If your thoughts jump into the past or the future, notice that and come back to your breath. Then put your hand on your heart and ask your question. Be &lsquo;open&rsquo; to receiving guidance, and stay in stillness to feel guided. The message may come as intuition or a sign &ndash; a song you hear on the radio perhaps, or a book, a friend calling &ndash; it could be anything, keep your mind open! Couple it with real-life practical research and act upon it. You will see changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other way to seek guidance is through an Angel Card Reader. Angel Cards are not like Tarot Cards, they are Oracle Cards made using the ancient Pythagorean Theories of Mathematics, and they carry beautifully positive, uplifting and constructive messages to help you understand your concerns and the reasons behind them. And here&rsquo;s how it works &ndash; You sit with an Angel Card Reader, quiet your mind, breathe, and ask your angels to talk to those of the Angel Card Reader, who in turn will feel the energy and intuit the messages that come, using the cards as a tool. The Cards act merely as a tool and are not to be treated as magical or future determining. The messages will have a personal translation into your life situation, and guidance on how you can better it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be fun to try this experiment a try. You may end up making yourself a whole lot happier and more peaceful in the process!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Based in Dubai, Delna Anand is a certified yoga teacher specialising in meditation and healing.

(51, 'Beauty products in your kitchen', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p>Toxin-free, natural homemade skincare is often overlooked yet produces fantastic results. By&nbsp;Sarah Bladen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toxic&nbsp;products exist almost everywhere &ndash; from supermarkets to department stores &ndash; and in bright, shiny packaging, looks can be deceiving. Despite seductive advertising, some of these well-known brands contain harmful chemicals (like parabens and petrochemicals) proven to be carcinogenic. But as consumers we have a choice as to what we put on our skin (so by default into our bloodstream and through our organs) and many safer alternatives without the hefty price tag, are overlooked. What you may not know is that you can find some of the best beauty products in your kitchen. That&rsquo;s right, you don&rsquo;t need to look further than your pantry to find an effective tried and tested remedy that has worked well for centuries. Not only do you save money with these eco-friendly options, they are also good for you. After all, they are edible. As well as doubling up as skincare, the natural wonders below can also be used for medicinal purposes. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WhAT: LemON JuIce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly a beauty wonder, lemon juice can fade age spots, freckles, and combat acne. It&rsquo;s also a natural facial &lsquo;peel&rsquo; and a super cheap way to get hair highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skincare:&nbsp;using lemon juice on&nbsp;your face helps to tighten and shrink pores, fight acne and fade freckles and pigmentation. Got a pimple? Dab a drop of lemon juice on it when you go &nbsp;to bed at night &ndash; the L-ascorbic acid in lemons is the active ingredient in many commercial acne products. If you&rsquo;re after a lighter complexion or want to fade pigmentation, the citric acid in lemons can whiten, brighten and lighten your skin. Squeeze the juice of a lemon or two into a little bowl then, with a cotton ball, apply to your pigmented areas and leave it on for up to 10 minutes before thoroughly rinsing with cool water. For best results, exfoliate first. mix a pinch of sugar or sea salt with the lemon juice. Some people do this daily; for other people that&rsquo;s too often. Initially, try every second day to gauge how your skin reacts. Like any bleaching or fading cream, lemon juice only works with regular use and results are gradual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re after some subtle highlights in your hair, lemon juice is also the way to go. One method is to combine lemon juice and hair conditioner, comb through your hair and sit in the sun before washing out. Repeat at least once a week for significantly lighter hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warnings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w Like any depigmentation treatment, lemon juice will make your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays so be extra vigilant with sunscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w If you&rsquo;ve got dry skin, undiluted lemon juice can exacerbate the condition so mix equal quantities of water and lemon juice in a little spray bottle. Just watch out for cuts, lemon juice can sting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w Be careful if you&rsquo;re already using other topical medical treatments, the lemon juice may not be a good combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinal Benefits:&nbsp;First thing in&nbsp;the morning, one of the best ways to detox your body is by drinking a tall glass of water with freshly squeezed lemon. Once in the body, lemon juice acts as an alkaliser, restoring your Ph levels and boosting your immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more tips and natural lemon juice beauty recipes, check out&nbsp;www.newhealthguide.org&nbsp;and&nbsp;www.livestrong.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT: APPLE CIDER VINEGAR<br />\r\nThis has been used as folk medicine for eons and with good reason. This magical liquid has fabulous healing properties and helps ease problematic skin &ndash; from blemishes to sunburn and eczema &ndash; it greatly reduces inflammation. It also acts as a toner and skin brightener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skincare:&nbsp;To make your apple cider vinegar (AcV) face wash, pour a tablespoon of AcV into a small bowl with three tablespoons of warm water and apply to your face with a cotton ball. If you have sensitive skin, use five tablespoons of water to a tablespoon of AcV. As your skin gets comfortable with it, you can go down to two or even one tablespoon of water. either leave on for 10 minutes and rinse or apply face oil over the top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about how your skin will react, first apply the diluted AcV to your wrist and leave it an hour to check for any redness or irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an all over body treatment, add a cup of apple cider vinegar and a cup of epsom salts to a hot bath to draw toxins out through the skin and help jumpstart the cleansing process. This can also help relieve joint pain as well as skin conditions like eczema and acne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinal Benefits:&nbsp;It is a brilliant natural remedy for sore throats and it can also double up as a natural mouth freshener. many have raved about Apple cider Vinegar for its detoxifying effects since it decreases glucose levels and fights a myriad of infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more tips and ACV beauty recipes, check out&nbsp;www.organicauthority.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WhAT: cOcONuT OIL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coconut oil has been shown to protect you from viruses, bacteria, infection, cancer, brain and heart problems&hellip; plus it beautifies your skin, burns fat and boosts your thyroid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For thousands of years coconut oil has been one of the most loved hair conditioners and for good reason.

(52, 'A raw deal: Why eating only raw food isnâ€™t always right', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', '', '', '<p><em>First up, this story is not an attack on our dear raw vegan friends, we commend their aim to tread more lightly on the planet and being raw vegan is always preferable to a burger and fries lifestyle. Yet, while raw food should be part of everyone&rsquo;s diet, aiming to be 100 per cent raw vegan isn&rsquo;t the best diet for everyone and can even be detrimental to health.<br />\r\nWords by&nbsp;Alison McLaughlin.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One&nbsp;of the latest food trends&nbsp;is consuming a diet that is purely made up of raw foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thinking behind the raw food movement is based upon the idea that when foods are cooked they lose many of their nutrients. Thus, if foods are uncooked and unprocessed they are automatically better for us. Consuming raw foods on a regular basis is an important part of healthy lifestyle. In fact, I encourage my clients to eat raw foods every single day because they support a healthy digestion system. But, eating only raw foods should not be defined as being the healthiest way to eat. In fact, some foods are not always better for you when they are eaten raw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research has shown that cooked vegetables make nutrients more bioavailable for our bodies to absorb. Specifically, when some vegetables are cooked, they end up having higher amounts of antioxidants (carotenoids and phytochemicals) when compared to their raw form. This increase in antioxidants is from the breaking down of cell matrix (where nutrients are bound) in vegetables. For example, the lycopene in tomatoes is more accessible to our bodies when tomatoes are cooked and cooking carrots makes the beta-carotene more available for the body to absorb. Leafy green vegetables such as spinach are also high in nutrients such as calcium and magnesium, which is more available for our bodies to absorb when these vegetables are cooked. Just one cup of raw spinach contains approximately 100 mg calcium, whereas one cup of cooked spinach contains approximately 260 mg of calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some raw foods can decrease thyroid function. Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts), although highly nutritious, release a compound called goitrin during digestion. Goitrin can interfere with thyroid function and the synthesis of thyroid hormones. When you consume goitrogens, they may inhibit your body&rsquo;s ability to absorb iodine &ndash; an essential mineral required for thyroid function &ndash; and reduce your body&rsquo;s ability to produce thyroid hormones that regulate energy use. Low levels of thyroid hormones &ndash; a condition called hypothyroidism &ndash; are associated with unexplained weight gain and poor health. Individuals with hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) and iodine deficiency may benefit from cooking these vegetables, which takes away most or all of their goitrogenic properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, if we cook foods until they are burnt or turn black, they will lose&nbsp;the majority of their nutrients. But some raw food proponents make it seem that cooking healthy foods such as vegetables means they become &lsquo;processed&rsquo; foods. This is simply not the case. Processed foods come in packages. There is nothing processed about having a side of steamed vegetables for dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most preferred cooking methods to maintain/enhance nutrients in vegetables is steaming. Research shows steaming can increase antioxidant capacity, while boiling may lead to&nbsp;a loss of nutrients, especially water soluble nutrients such as vitamin C, folate and thiamin. Other methods of cooking such as baking, stewing, grilling, and microwaving have been shown&nbsp;as beneficial for breaking down the&nbsp;cell walls in vegetables (making more nutrients available). Cooking breaks apart fibres and cellular walls to release nutrients that otherwise we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to absorb from the same raw food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s important to realise what foods you will be missing out on if&nbsp;you eat solely raw foods. For example, someone who only eats raw foods will usually not be able to consume any kind of legumes such as beans and lentils &ndash; unless they have the time, patience and skill of a raw food chef. Legumes offer a wide variety of nutrients, and are a good source of protein and fibre. Eggs are another food that should not be eaten raw (but can be), because of the possibility of being contaminated with salmonella. Eggs are one food that should not be intentionally cut out of a diet, as they are full of vitamins, minerals, healthy fats, high quality proteins, and antioxidants that support eye health (lutein and zeaxanthine).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE BOTTOM LINE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating raw foods is just one part of&nbsp;a healthy diet. I recommend eating&nbsp;a variety of raw and cooked foods to reap the health benefits that both have to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEGINNER&rsquo;S GUIDE TO RAW VEGANISM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw veganism is a plant-based diet that involves no cooking. No food is heated above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). Raw vegans believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost much of their nutritional value and are less healthful or even harmful to the body. In raw vegan speak, cooking is killing. Foods are eaten fresh, dehydrated with low heat, or fermented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many raw vegans refer to &lsquo;live&rsquo; foods versus &lsquo;dead&rsquo; foods. Live or uncooked foods are said to be filled with vital life energy so juicing and blending green smoothies are usually key elements of this diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raw veganism is an extension&nbsp;of the vegan appreciation for animal welfare, with the added spirituality&nbsp;of a life force, called chi or prana. Dead or cooked foods are said to be depleted of their life energy, as well as most of their nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among raw vegans there are subgroups such as fruitarians, juicearians, or sproutarians. Fruitarians eat primarily or exclusively fruits, berries, seeds, and nuts. Juicearians process their raw plant foods into juice. Sproutarians adhere to a diet consisting mainly of sprouted seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RAW VEGAN RISKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tooth decay:&nbsp;Some people on a raw food diet rely so much on fruit that their teeth begin to erode: from acids in the fruits that wear down the tooth enamel, from sugar promoting decay, from dried fruit sticking to the teeth and further promoting decay, and from a general mineral deficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutritional deficiencies:&nbsp;On a raw vegan diet it&rsquo;s difficult or impossible to get vitamins B12 and D, selenium, zinc, iron and two omega-3 fatty acids, DHA and EPA, without taking supplements. Vitamins D and B12, and Omega 3 fatty acids are nutrients that women particularly need as they age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Child development:&nbsp;A child raised on a raw, vegan diet without proper supplementation would likely develop severe neurological and growth problems due to a lack of vitamin B12 and other nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on the risks of a raw vegan diet, read the article called&nbsp;Reality Check: 5 Risks of Raw Vegan Diet&nbsp;by&nbsp;Christopher Wanjek&nbsp;at&nbsp;www.livescience.com&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RAW FOOD QUEEN&rsquo;S U-TURN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Victoria Boutenko&nbsp;is one of the world&rsquo;s most well-known and influential raw foodists. She has been integral in bringing raw veganism into the mainstream with several books including&nbsp;12 Steps to Raw Food,&nbsp;published in 2000. However, more recently, even Boutenko has backed away from a regimented attitude on the raw food diet, here&rsquo;s part of what she wrote in her blog on 9 January 2010&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I noticed feeling progregressively more sensitive when talking to people who were struggling to stick to a 60%, 70%, 80%, or whatever % raw diet. All of a sudden, I realized that my book&nbsp;12 Steps to Raw Foods&nbsp;(first edition) contained fanaticism about 100% raw foodism. Soon I completely revised this book and published the second edition, which I find to be a much kinder book, and perhaps more useful because of that.

(53, 'Going Gluten-free', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', '', '', '<p><em>A beginner&rsquo;s guide to the why and how of removing gluten from your diet.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;is gluten?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gluten is a protein found in all forms of wheat, rye and barley. It is most commonly found in food but also hides in medicine, vitamins and make-up. The first thing you should do when starting a gluten-free diet&nbsp;is schedule a meeting with a skilled dietitian or nutritionist. A dietitian or nutritionist can help you learn the basics of a gluten-free diet and help you find ways to adapt your lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens if you eat gluten?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gluten is essentially toxic to people with Celiac Disease. Unlike an allergic reaction, someone with Celiac will&nbsp;not go into anaphylactic shock if&nbsp;they eat gluten, instead experiencing physical symptoms such as: diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, skin rashes or headaches. Continuing to consume gluten puts you at risk for long-term damage to the small intestines. There&nbsp;is no medical treatment to prevent the body from attacking the gut once gluten has been ingested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gluten-free diet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gluten is a protein found in all forms&nbsp;of wheat, rye and barley. It&rsquo;s most commonly found in food, but also can hide in medicine, vitamins and make- up. After being diagnosed, you should schedule a meeting with a skilled dietitian or nutritionist as soon as possible to help you learn the basics of a gluten-free diet and find ways to adapt it your lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How quickly does the gluten- free diet work?<br />\r\nPatients who strictly follow the gluten- free diet can begin to experience relief of symptoms within a few days, although it can take up to six months for the small intestine to heal in children and potentially two years to repair fully in adults. Don&rsquo;t expect immediate results, just keep following the gluten-free diet and you&rsquo;ll feel better soon enough!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are some unsafe ingredients to avoid especially when ordering/eating out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barley, Bran, Croutons, Dextrin,&nbsp;Rye, Macha, Malt, Oats, Rice Syrup, Tabbouleh, Udon, Wheat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are some safe ingredients?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Milk (not flavoured with ingredients that contain gluten, such as malt), 100 per cent fruit or vegetable juices, fresh fruit and vegetables, butter, eggs, lentils, beans (in their natural, unprocessed form), peanuts, seeds (such as flax), tree nuts (such as almonds), quinoa, fresh fish (cod, salmon, etc), fresh shellfish (clams, oysters), fresh meats/ poultry (unbreaded), honey and water (including bottled, distilled, spring).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you maintain a balanced diet while gluten-free?&nbsp;Adjusting to a gluten-free diet can&nbsp;be tricky, so it&rsquo;s important to ensure you are getting all the nutrients you need to stay healthy. Fortunately, many of the healthiest foods, such as vegetables, fruits, beans/lentils, nuts and seeds, low-fat unflavoured dairy products, lean meats, fish, and chicken are naturally gluten-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, some gluten- free products increase the sugar or fat content to compensate for texture and flavour changes that can result from the removal of gluten. Look for products that do not have sugar, syrups, or fat listed high on the ingredient list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When first starting a gluten-free diet, it also can be beneficial to meet with a dietitian or nutrition specialist who will help you get started and stay healthy.</p>\r\n', 'gluten-free-written-in-flour-450x337.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:09:36'),

British people are on average three stone (19 kg) heavier than they were in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the BBC documentary,&nbsp;The Men Who Made Us Fat,&nbsp;Jacques Peretti investigates the men responsible for the transformation in our eating habits; how business changed the shape of a nation, as well as how the food industry choreographs temptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obesity rates have doubled since the 1980s and according to Peretti, we&rsquo;re in a war between our bodies and modern accessibility to fast and processed food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971, US President Richard Nixon appointed Earl Butz&nbsp;as Secretary of Agriculture. Butz had a vision to merge the country&rsquo;s army of small farmlets into enormous, industrial farms of unprecedented output. &ldquo;Get big or get out&rdquo; was Butz&rsquo;s motto and his plan was to grow more corn than ever before, in order to keep food prices cheap and housewives happy who would then vote his party back into government. Soon, these new, larger harvests of corn became feed for the cheaper beef flooding the supermarkets and huge surpluses of corn were being created &ndash; this was soon turned into a brand new food thanks to some Japanese scientists, it was a cheap industrial sweetener called High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). This cheap corn sweetener has ended up in just about every processed food imaginable &ndash; take for example the typical American fast food meal of a burger, fries with tomato sauce and a Coke; the beef is from cows fed on corn; the Coke and tomato sauce are sweetened with corn syrup; the bread for the bun is made with corn syrup, and the fries are cooked in corn oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SUCROSE VS FRUCTOSE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest health impact though was when HFCS replaced sugar in fizzy drinks like Coke and Pepsi in 1984. The reason was a no brainer &ndash; HFCS was a third cheaper than sugar. In two decades, fizzy drink consumption in the US has gone from 350 cans per person per year to 600 cans per year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The damaging difference between regular processed sugar and HFCS is how it affects the body. There&rsquo;s something very specific about fructose that accelerates obesity, namely, the effect of fructose on the liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to endocrinologist, Dr Robert Lustig, fructose is easily converted to fat in the body, and scientists have found that it also suppresses the action of a vital hormone called leptin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Leptin goes from your fat cells to your brain and tells your brain you&rsquo;ve had enough, you don&rsquo;t need to eat that second piece of cheesecake,&rdquo; said Lustig in an interview with Peretti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the liver is overloaded with sugars, leptin simply stops working, and as a result the body doesn&rsquo;t know when it&rsquo;s full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It makes your brain think you&rsquo;re starving and now what you have is a vicious cycle of consumption, disease and addiction. Which explains what has happened the world over,&rdquo; Lustig said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americans eat about 90lbs of added sugar per year. This is like a tsunami of sugar hitting the liver, which impacts fat in the blood leading to heart disease as well as fat in the liver, leading to diabetes and chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SUGAR JUNKIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is it that we just can&rsquo;t seem to get enough sugar? Because it is literally addictive. Sugar takes the brain prisoner by activating the same circuitry that is activated in addictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The havoc that processed sugars have wreaked on global health and obesity is now being more widely studied and accepted but this is a recent change. For the last 40 years, accepted wisdom was that we were all getting fatter, quicker because of fat. It was American scientist Ancel Keys who convinced the developed world that dietary fat, particularly animal fat, was the cause of heart disease (interestingly, the more subtle finding in his work that did not get so widely promoted was that animal protein and fat increased heart disease while plant fat decreased it).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One scientist who disagreed with Keys&rsquo; anti-fat stance was UK Professor John Yudkin. In 1972, Yudkin wrote a book called&nbsp;<em>Pure, White and Deadly</em>, which outlined how the rise in heart disease correlated to the rise in the consumption of sugar. This was not a popular argument with the influential sugar lobby however and Yudkin was basically black-listed and discredited by powerful sugar-funded opponents. As a result, the case against sugar was forgotten and the low-fat obsession took hold. The result? Obesity rates in the UK are now 10 times what they were in the 1970s and the amount of sugar eaten has increased by<br />\r\n31 per cent since 1990 because of the &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; sugar added to products like tomato sauce, soft- drinks, yogurt, baked beans, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When dietary fat became public health enemy number one, the food industry spied an opportunity and before long our supermarket shelves were swamped with low fat products &ndash; everything from yogurts to mayonnaise, biscuits and desserts. The low-fat industry boomed. Fat was taken out and sugar was put in. As a result, profits for the food industry have soared and so have obesity rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on The Men Who Made Us Fat by BBC Two, go to&nbsp;www.bbc.co.uk</p>\r\n', 'fat-woman-eating-nutella-450x337.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:45:59'),
(55, 'The three month Quit Sugar challenge', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p>Is sugar the sweet poison that some claim? A married couple go low-sugar for three months to see what happens to their bodies and moods&hellip; words by&nbsp;Tamara Pitelen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is&nbsp;the amount of processed sugar&nbsp;in the modern diet responsible for everything from diabetes and obesity to cancer? How difficult is it to cut refined sugar out of your life and what happens if you do? That&rsquo;s what my husband Adrian and I are aiming to find out with the three month Quit Sugar challenge. You may have read part one in the previous issue of&nbsp;<em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;magazine where we wrote about doing a two-month challenge&hellip; we decided to add a month. This story takes up where we left off at the end of the last story. To recap, we&rsquo;ve adjusted our normal eating to avoid any food with more than five grams of sugar per 100 gms and any beverage with more than zero grams of sugar per 100 gms (except milk &ndash; Adrian is still drinking milk and I&rsquo;m drinking unsweetened almond milk). To give an example of how this has changed things, Adrian now eats a whole new breakfast &ndash; no more branflakes (20gms of sugar per 100gms), low-fat yogurt (10gms of sugar per 100gms) and orange juice (basically all sugar); instead our usual breakfast is now two free range eggs and smoked salmon &ndash; the sugar went down but the price went way up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, we&rsquo;ve discovered that there are a number of approaches to the low-sugar lifestyle. Some people simply cut out refined, added sugars like sugar in tea, cake, biscuits, fizzy drinks, etc. Other people go even further and&nbsp;avoid all foods that the body processes as sugar &ndash; this is everything from&nbsp;honey and agave syrup to bread, pasta, potato, fruit, rice, and so on. The approach we were initially following&nbsp;is recommended by anti-sugar author David Gillespie, an Australian man&nbsp;who lost 40kgs apparently effortlessly by going low sugar and then wrote a best-selling book about it called&nbsp;Sweet Poison: How sugar makes you fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Week nine: GLUTEN AND DAIRY FREE<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s been exactly two months since we went low-sugar. For the last 10 days, we&rsquo;ve upped the ante and also gone gluten-free, caffeine-free and dairy-free as well because we bought a book by Dr Mark Hyman called&nbsp;The Blood Solution 10 Day Detox Diet.&nbsp;Hyman says we&rsquo;re all sugar addicts and the $1 trillion industrial food system is the biggest drug dealer around, contributing to tens of millions of deaths every year. He writes: &ldquo;You are hooked &ndash; a junkie mainlining some of the worst, deadliest drugs on the planet: sugar and anything that turns to sugar in your body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we&rsquo;ve been following Hyman&rsquo;s suggestions and both Adrian and I are starting to notice some changes. My cholesterol has gone from a &ldquo;worryingly high&rdquo; 206 mg/dl [the medical assistant at LifeLine Medical Centre who tested me a while back]to a safe-zone 120 mg/dl. Measuring cholesterol is a bit confusing though. We bought one of those home test kits so we could test ourselves once a week. For no reason we can figure out yet, the results can swing wildly from week to week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Week 11:&nbsp;DETOX REACTION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve just come out of a five-day cellular detox crisis that felt like something between having the flu and falling off a wall. I felt battered. At first, I didn&rsquo;t realise it could be a detox reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I woke up feeling like I&rsquo;d been hit by&nbsp;a bus so I called in sick at work and dragged myself off to the doctors. It felt like a bad cold or flu was kicking in, you know, when you&rsquo;re aching all over and&nbsp;a bit emotional. I felt exhausted and just craved being allowed to sleep for about two days. I&rsquo;m embarrassed to say I even cried in the doctor&rsquo;s office out of self- pity, it&rsquo;s a surprise she didn&rsquo;t prescribe me anti-depressants. Much to my consternation though, the doctors and nurses couldn&rsquo;t find anything wrong with me. They took my temperature, did blood and urine tests as well as whatever else they test with their stethoscopes and thermometers but I was absolutely fine as far as they were concerned. So why on earth did I feel so utterly, indescribably awful? I asked the doctor, getting all teary again. She didn&rsquo;t know and told me to come back in a few days if I hadn&rsquo;t improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next two days, I didn&rsquo;t leave the house, the aches and pains in my hips and lower back were so bad I took painkillers at night and slept in our spare bedroom so my thrashing about and moaning didn&rsquo;t wake up Adrian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for answers, I re-read a book called&nbsp;The Body Talks: Heal Your Weight&nbsp;by Judy Cole. She describes the difference between a regular digestive detox, which lasts a few days or a week or two, and&nbsp;a deeper, cellular detox. Here&rsquo;s what<br />\r\nshe says about a cellular detox: &ldquo;We are detoxing the residues of foods our bodies have not properly eliminated from the blood and then have stored in the cells over many years. It takes the body at least two months to flush the accumulated food intolerance residue out of the cells, during which time you will have ups and downs of feeling great and terrible! A commitment to an initial strict avoidance of your foods for two months is a must on the long road to completely healing your weight&hellip; try and avoid them for four months in order to allow a deeper healing to take place in your cells. If for example food has been the cause of irritable bowel symptoms such as bloating, pain and gas, these foods will have left your gut inflamed. This damage can take as long as five months to repair&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Coles, symptoms of a cellular detox include:<br />\r\n&bull; Deep fatigue and sleepiness<br />\r\n&bull; Emotional outburst<br />\r\n&bull; Worsening of some disorders<br />\r\n&bull; Cravings<br />\r\n&bull; Nausea<br />\r\n&bull; Headaches above the eyes<br />\r\n&bull; Cold or flu-like symptoms<br />\r\n&bull; Strange aches and pains in the body<br />\r\n&bull; Skin reactions such as acne, rashes, cracked lips<br />\r\n&bull; Changes in the menstrual cycle, which will rebalance in three to four months</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, did I experience a cellular detox? Maybe. After five days, all the symptoms had vanished. According to Cole, a really deep detox can take six months to a year. As the body feels safe to release some of the gunk stored in your cells into your blood stream for removal from the body, you&rsquo;re going to feel terrible. It will pass, you&rsquo;ll feel ok again and then if the body still feels safe (ie, you haven&rsquo;t consumed anything that causes intolerant reactions), it will dump another load of gunk from the cells to the blood stream, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THRee MOnTHS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of unexpected changes have been to my fingernails, tongue and menstrual cycle &ndash; apologies if some of the details to come are a little &lsquo;too much information&rsquo; for the more squeamish reader but I&rsquo;m going to be reasonably forthright in case my experience helps someone reading this &ndash; maybe you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last few years, I&rsquo;d been&nbsp;unable to grow my nails longer than the&nbsp;fingertips. My nails would crack, break,&nbsp;or split and cuticles were dried out&nbsp;and ragged. They&rsquo;re still hardly ready&nbsp;for any hand modeling jobs but for&nbsp;the first time in many years, my nails are now getting some length. Another&nbsp;thing is that, in the past for as long as I&nbsp;can remember, I always had a vaguely<br />\r\nunpleasant thick white coating on the&nbsp;back of my tongue. It&rsquo;s now noticeably&nbsp;decreased, almost gone at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for my menstrual cycle, that has&nbsp;significantly changed. For many years,&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve had an unusually short cycle; it<br />\r\nwould come round every 21 to 24 days.&nbsp;But for the last two months the cycle has&nbsp;been 30 and 35 days. Is it connected? It&rsquo;ll<br />\r\nbe interesting to see how if that balances&nbsp;out in the next few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE SUMMARY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a really interesting&nbsp;experiment. Three months ago, Adrian&nbsp;ate branflakes every morning along with a freshly squeezed orange juice. Today, he wouldn&rsquo;t touch those foods with a barge pole. We&rsquo;ve had slips and slides along the way of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t be realistic to think we wouldn&rsquo;t but we&rsquo;re convinced that avoiding sugar, gluten and dairy the majority of the time has made a positive difference to our health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LOW SUGAR CHALLENGE RESULTS</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>&nbsp;</td>\r\n			<td>Tam Day 1</td>\r\n			<td>Tam Day 90</td>\r\n			<td>Result</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Weight</td>\r\n			<td>68.5 kg</td>\r\n			<td>66.6 kg</td>\r\n			<td>-1.9 kg</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Fat</td>\r\n			<td>33%</td>\r\n			<td>32%</td>\r\n			<td>-1%</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Bone</td>\r\n			<td>2.0</td>\r\n			<td>2.0</td>\r\n			<td>No change</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Water</td>\r\n			<td>46.9</td>\r\n			<td>48.2</td>\r\n			<td>+1.3</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Muscle mass</td>\r\n			<td>35</td>\r\n			<td>36.1</td>\r\n			<td>1.1</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Blood glucose</td>\r\n			<td>101</td>\r\n			<td>92</td>\r\n			<td>-9</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>Cholesterol</td>\r\n			<td>172 mg/dl</td>\r\n			<td>143 mg/dl</td>\r\n			<td>-29 mg/dl</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Tam says: &ldquo;Feeling a bit trimmer is nice but I won&rsquo;t lie, after three months of big dietary changes, I was hoping for a few more kilos to drop off.

I also feel much better within myself, put can&rsquo;t really put a finger on that other than I feel healthier. My figures show that I am lighter, leaner and better hydrated than at the start, but some of this I have to put down to additional exercise and going fairly hard core at the end.

It was American scientist Ancel Keys who convinced the developed world that dietary fat, particularly animal fat, was the cause of heart disease (interestingly, the more subtle finding in his work that did not get so widely promoted was that animal protein and fat increased heart disease while plant fat decreased it).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One scientist who disagreed with Keys&rsquo; anti-fat stance was UK Professor John Yudkin. In 1972, Yudkin wrote a book called&nbsp;<em>Pure, White and Deadly</em>, which outlined how the rise in heart disease correlated to the rise in the consumption of sugar. This was not a popular argument with the influential sugar lobby however and Yudkin was basically black-listed and discredited by powerful sugar-funded opponents. As a result, the case against sugar was forgotten and the low-fat obsession took hold. The result? Obesity rates in the UK are now 10 times what they were in the 1970s and the amount of sugar eaten has increased by<br />\r\n31 per cent since 1990 because of the &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; sugar added to products like tomato sauce, soft- drinks, yogurt, baked beans, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When dietary fat became public health enemy number one, the food industry spied an opportunity and before long our supermarket shelves were swamped with low fat products &ndash; everything from yogurts to mayonnaise, biscuits and desserts. The low-fat industry boomed. Fat was taken out and sugar was put in. As a result, profits for the food industry have soared and so have obesity rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on The Men Who Made Us Fat by BBC Two, go to&nbsp;www.bbc.co.uk</p>\r\n', 'sugar-cubes-wooden-spoon-450x337.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:39:19');

With more people opting for alternative paths to health, wellness and happiness, expressing yourself creatively &ndash; be this anything from art, to woodwork, dance, cooking or making model aeroplanes &ndash; is an effective tool for rebalancing and releasing stress or pent-up emotion. Yet, increasingly creative expression is taking a back seat to social media. The technology available at our fingertips makes it difficult to tune out the Facebook feeds, Twitter alerts or photo galleries on Pinterest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As creative beings, we need outlets to express ourselves and nurture our inner selves. It does us no good to choke the pipelines of our creative souls by letting distractions of the outer world take over our lives. Living life without creative expression leaves us feeling repressed and robotic. From here, the inner darkness can manifest as illness and the depression that destroys relationships with ourselves and with others. I know this from personal experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, I repressed my creativity to the point of disowning it completely. As an adult third culture kid, I was faced with the perennial &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t fit in because I do not belong anywhere&rsquo; imbroglio. Added to that was the criticism from business peers who couldn&rsquo;t understand how a molecular biologist like me could also be artistic. So I shut down my creative side to survive in the corporate world of engineering and medicine. My shackled creative being, relegated to the dark corners of the universe, kept calling for attention and expression but I refused to listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 10 years, I blocked my creativity and denied my emotions. As a result I hit rock bottom and this was the impetus I needed to resurrect the imprisoned creative self. That&rsquo;s when I bought some art paper and pastels, sat on the floor, and started to paint. This was three years ago and I&rsquo;ve never looked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ART AS A HEALING TOOL IN CLINICAL SETTINGS<br />\r\nSince the beginning of time, mankind&nbsp;has used the arts in a cultural setting for building strong community bonds. This has included painting, sculpting, drama, dance, music, poetry and singing. It was only in the 20th Century that the arts was used formally as a field called &lsquo;art therapy&rsquo; when doctors observed mental health patients expressing their feelings through painting. Since then, hospitals and health institutions around the world use art in conjunction with traditional medications to help improve the patient&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When art is used alongside psychotherapy and psychiatry, the patient&nbsp;is helped by both the doctors and the art therapists to deal with emotions and fears that are bottled up. According to a research paper by Stuckey and nobel1, patients prefer art therapy to verbal communication because the art modalities help them express how they feel where words cannot. Visual art therapy has many facets to it: painting in various media, sketching, doodling, clay work, sculptures,&nbsp;art journaling, and all forms of handcrafting (such as crochet, knitting, embroidery, textiles making or jewelry making).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art as therapy has been used with prisoners, with sexually abused children, with terminally ill cancer patients, with those who suffer from chronic depression, and with those suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. With cardiovascular diseases</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and diabetes being the number one killer diseases in the UAe, it is possible to use creative activities to help decrease stress that can be the underlying causes of such chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BENEFITS OF ART IN EVERY DAY LIFE<br />\r\nNot only is painting used in therapy, it can be used in daily life. You do not have to be an artist to be able to creatively express yourself. It&rsquo;s not about learning a particular painting technique or taking a formal art study program. That means that excuses such as, &lsquo;I am not a writer, I am not a musician, I am not a dancer, I am not an artist,&rsquo; etc don&rsquo;t hold true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art offers a safe place for us to be just as we are without any judgement. It is a sanctuary in the midst of our chaotic life. It&rsquo;s about allowing us to awaken the deep desires we once had. Art opens endless possibilities in our imagination to find creative methods of expressing anything we want to. For many, it has a calming effect, which then decreases stress. For those of us who reach out for food or other unhealthy substances when we want to stuff down emotions, art gives&nbsp;us a chance to find better and healthier coping strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already practice prayer and meditation, great. In my case, I found that creative expression paved the way to daily prayer and meditation, as well as mindful eating, exercising and clearing the clutter. of course, life didn&rsquo;t change the minute I applied acrylics to canvas. Being creatively blocked for a very long time meant that I had to take baby steps. In time, painting helped defrost major writing blocks. More recently, painting has become my way&nbsp;of delving deeper into my third culture and cross-cultural identity. Art has truly become the perfect point of alchemy, where life becomes whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YOUR &lsquo;GET ARTY&rsquo; KICK START</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get your creative juices flowing, buy a set of coloured crayons, pastels or acrylic paints and a paper pad then take 20 minutes to draw, paint, doodle&hellip; whatever comes up when you ask yourself the question, &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Find 20 minutes of alone time. Turn off all mobile phones, TV and other distractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Close your eyes, take three long breaths. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Breathe from your stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Meditate for a minimum of one minute up to five minutes (optional)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Ignore the chattering mind and thoughts that may attack in droves. When you find that this is happening, simply draw your attention back to breathing from the depths of your stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Now, gently bring to mind the topic of &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo; into your awareness. Go deep in your body and feel this question in your body. What is it saying to you? When you feel that question, what colour, smells or fragrances come to mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Pick the colour crayons of choice and start to draw whatever you feel like. Do not draw from your mind, but engage from your being. Your deeper self knows it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Use music if that helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Refrain from any sort of judgement or critical voices that may come up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Take 15 minutes to paint away and find a way to close this exercise, perhaps with three deep breaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Enjoy your piece of art!</p>\r\n', 'brushes-and-canvas-450x337.jpg', '2019-07-27 06:47:53'),
(57, 'Distance healing: Scam or science?', 'body', 'featured', '', '', '', '<p><em>Einstein described it as &lsquo;spooky action at a distance&rsquo;. Can someone heal someone despite not being in the same room &ndash; or even in the same country? Economist turned healer and author&nbsp;Evelyn Brodie&nbsp;investigates distance healing.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&nbsp;is common these days to find energy healers advertising distance healing to people that are unable to attend a therapist in person. Skeptics have frequently been dismissed such claims as impossible and hence fraudulent. Even those making them could only ask for clients&rsquo; trust, without being able to provide any logical or scientific explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last few years however,&nbsp;new discoveries from quantum mechanics have validated the existence of &lsquo;non-locality&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s called at the microcosmic level and a plethora&nbsp;of scientific analyses of distance healing have verified its veracity at the macrocosmic level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quantum mechanics and the holographic universe<br />\r\nOne of the reasons that these discoveries are not better known is that the maths is hard and the conclusions fly in the face of our everyday experience of &lsquo;reality&rsquo;. Professor Richard Feynman,&nbsp;a pioneer of quantum mechanics who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, is quoted as stating,&nbsp;&lsquo;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&rsquo;&nbsp;Even Albert Einstein, the father of general relativity theory, denounced quantum physics as a flawed theory in 1935, saying it inferred bizarre and nonsensical concepts such as &lsquo;spooky action at a distance&rsquo;, whereby particles could somehow &lsquo;communicate&rsquo; instantaneously with each other over vast distances. This seemed to contradict Einstein&rsquo;s theory that nothing could travel faster than light; hence he concluded that quantum physics had to be wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last few decades however, some of the most modern and technologically advanced experiments conducted in linear accelerators have proved Einstein wrong and quantum physics correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simplistically, if you split a particle and put one part say in the Stanford Linear Accelerator and the other part in the CERN facility, then when you change the direction of spin on one part of the particle, the other part also, simultaneously, changes direction. That is the demonstrated fact of non-locality. But how does the one half know what its other half is doing? The answer seems to be some sort of energetic entanglement at the quantum level with an omniscient and omnipresent field of information which is &lsquo;just there&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A metaphor that was coined by Professor David Bohm is that of the &lsquo;holographic universe&rsquo;. If a hologram&nbsp;is smashed into millions of pieces,&nbsp;each piece contains the whole picture but from a different perspective. This holographic universe or entangled field of information is now being given many names by different branches of science and medicine, such as the knowing field, the info-realm, the collective consciousness, the Akashic field. Metaphysically it has traditionally been called God or Brahman or Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-locality finally starts to explain how each one of us as a piece of the holographic universe is capable of accessing all the information that exists &lsquo;out there&rsquo; so long as our brains can &lsquo;tune in&rsquo; at the right frequency, just as you need a light source vibrating at the right frequency to read a hologram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DR LARRY DOSSEY&rsquo;S THREE ERAS OF HEALING<br />\r\nDr. Larry Dossey in the USA describes three eras of healing. Era I is the now old-fashioned Western model which believes the body is simply a mechanism and the only solutions are physical or pharmacological.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Era II, which is gradually becoming the accepted norm, derives from the work of psycho-neuroimmunologists and euroscientists and admits there&nbsp;is memory in cells throughout the body, not just in the brain. It accepts the psychosomatic effects of one&rsquo;s<br />\r\nown consciousness on one&rsquo;s own body. This allows us to have a highly significant influence over our physical and emotional health through our thoughts and beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Era III is where the mind is described as &lsquo;non-local&rsquo; and unconfined by either space or time. It recognises that our non-local mind may affect healing both within and between people. Non-contact and distance healing become possible with non-local mind, as do healings backwards and forwards in time (for instance working with past lives or the ancestors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EVIDENCE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as linear accelerators have proven the existence of non-locality at the quantum level, Dossey and others have been working to collect the evidence that proves the existence of non- locality at the mind level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;Healing Beyond the Body,&nbsp;he reports the results of many meta analyses of Era III medicines. For instance, studies conducted&nbsp;over two decades at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory show that non-local awareness operates through time as well as through space, showing odds against chance of one hundred billion to one that mentally sent images chosen at random from a computer data bank, are actually perceived by the &lsquo;receiver&rsquo; precognitively up to several days before being sent and before being selected by the computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Soul Medicine Institute has&nbsp;set up the first international database&nbsp;of energy psychology case histories. It&nbsp;is peer reviewed and conforms to the Consort Standards and the Standards&nbsp;of the National Institutes of Health. In&nbsp;a book based on the results reported<br />\r\nto the Institute, Dawson Church and Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D. document over one hundred scientific studies,&nbsp;and dozens of medically verified &lsquo;miraculous&rsquo; cures, that demonstrate the power of thought, prayer and belief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hundreds more similar reports are now available and the bibliography to my book [see author box out]lists a number of useful sources of this research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMPLICATIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most people, accessing the info- realm is most easily achieved through experiences such as meditation or plant medicines. And access brings us new ways of healing ourselves, physically and emotionally, giving us much greater control over our own health and destinies than many of us have been conditioned to believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many healers are also able to access the info-realm and this work outside conventional space and time is what the traditional shamans have been doing for centuries. One interesting observation that emerged from the work of Robert Beck as far back as the 1960s, is that healers&rsquo; brains appear to operate in a particular electromagnetic frequency range which is in alignment with the frequency of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. Church reports Beck&rsquo;s work as follows.&nbsp;&lsquo;The Earth resonates&nbsp;at an average frequency of 7.8Hz, while the dominant brainwave frequency of sensitives, such as shamans and healers, comes close to 7.83Hz, and may, at times, beat in phase with the Earth&rsquo;s signal, thereby causing harmonic resonance&hellip; They appear to be tapping into a universal frequency that is implicated in healing, and is effective regardless of the belief structure of the healer.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So distance healing seems to involve the healer entering into an altered state of consciousness that allows access<br />\r\nto the info-realm and connection or entanglement with the client through that universal energy field. Just because distance healing can work of course doesn&rsquo;t imply it always will work. As with attending a healer in person it is essential to pick someone that you resonate with. Neuroscience tells us that mirroring the neuronal pathways of a grounded and empathic therapist is one of the keys to helping traumatised clients, so the client- therapist relationship is crucial whether in person or at a distance &ndash; but that is a topic for another time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evelyn Brodie&nbsp;works in London, UK, as&nbsp;a shaman, a Reiki Master and a craniosacral therapist, helping clients to release trauma,&nbsp;stress, depression, physical illness and limiting beliefs.

(58, 'Juice fasting in Thailand', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>Detox expert&nbsp;Malcolm Slyper&nbsp;describes his 10-day Juice fast detox in Thailand &ndash; this one is not for beginners.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am&nbsp;often asked for ideas on how to do an inexpensive detox trip to a lush tropical island location away from the bustle of city life. So I decided to share a recent detox and juice fasting experience of my own. I&rsquo;ve explained all and included various hints, tips and ideas to use in your own detox efforts but bear in mind that I have extensive experience in detox and fasting and the regime I undertook is not for beginners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, the world&nbsp;offers a range of detox experiences from the mild to the more extreme with everything in-between, so why not escape to somewhere quiet and beautiful to undergo a detox that suits your body and health goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally like to be somewhere exquisite where I can relax into a juice fast detox. This means I can kick back and know with certainty that I am tapping into the most powerful innate healing ability that&rsquo;s wired into each and every one of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do this fast once or twice a year.&nbsp;Most recently, I chose a remote part of rural Thailand near Koh Samui Island in Southern Thailand on the Bay of Bangkok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I needed a quiet place where I would have access to fresh juices and daily Thai massage to assist with moving the stirred up toxins out of the body. Thai Massage is exceptional as an aid to fasting in that it helps move the stagnant lymphatic system; it also balances and harmonises the human energy field. When done&nbsp;by a talented practitioner the results&nbsp;are nothing short of spectacular.&nbsp;Past experience has shown me that 90-minute massages are most beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also needed a place where I had access to a form of energy healing to assist with the mental, emotional and spiritual balancing potential to which the fast would give me access. For me, this person is Jet Lei, one of the most talented energy healers that I have ever met. Jet grew up in a monastery in Tibet and in his early twenties he was schooled in certain healing arts. He later learnt chiropractic at a Beijing School of Martial Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily for me, Jet&rsquo;s partner Chai is an excellent Thai masseuse and together they live on the mainland side of the Bay of Bangkok so it was a no brainer that I chose this paradise location as my base for my 10-day juice fast detox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PINEAPPLES AND COCONUT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rented a single bedroom beach house with kitchen and sitting room for 1,300 Thai Baht (AED 145) per night. It was located 50 metres from the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally I would set out to do a 10 day orange juice fast. However on this occasion, oranges were in short supply so I chose pineapple. All fruit are effective cleansers. Jet Lei still had the Vitamix juicer that I&rsquo;d brought a couple of years earlier so he dusted that off and presented it back to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it was time to bring in the supplies. A visit to the local market secured several kilograms of fresh sweet Thai pineapple. Pineapples cost 20 baht each (AED 2.5). Pineapple is slightly sweeter than orange and thus needs to be watered down more. As a result I&rsquo;d be using quarter pineapple juice to a glass of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pineapple has a herbal history of extracting lead and metals from the body. A study conducted showed that population groups consuming high amounts of pineapple had lower lead levels. The daily regime calls for a glass of diluted juice every hour, with as much water in between as one wishes to consume. I&rsquo;d also be drinking coconut water in between the juices to stay hydrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would occasionally substitute&nbsp;the glasses of water for an occasional coconut. The Thai coconuts contain clear white coconut water that is rich in both minerals and electrolytes. The ideal means to support any juice fast. A friend of Jet&rsquo;s agreed to pull down twenty fresh coconuts from a nearby coconut tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one law that should not be broken whilst fasting: The bowels must expel daily regardless if you have not eaten for several weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to ensure that my bowels would move on a daily basis, I carried a 10-day supply of the Lower Bowel Formulae, abbreviated as LBB. It&rsquo;s a remarkable formula originally designed to assist those fasting. It contains Cascara Sagrada Bark, Barberry Bark, Cayenne Pepper, Ginger Root, Lobelia Herb,&nbsp;Red Raspberry Leaves, Turkey Rhubarb Root, Fennel Seeds &amp; Goldenseal<br />\r\nRoot, it is available for purchase at&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LBB is a brilliant fasting&nbsp;aid and this formula means I can pick a remote location for fasting without access to any pricey colon hydrotherapy equipment or services. The LBB formula is remarkable at cleaning out old waste stored deep within the small and large intestine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having fasted extensively over the years, and also having done routine maintenance on myself throughout the preceding months, there was no real need for me to do a formal pre cleanse prior to starting the fast. It was already done, and I was good to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRE-FAST PREP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My approach to fasting is to use the preceding months to do a series of pre cleanses, whilst adjusting the diet to a healthier approach before embarking upon the fast. This method ensures a deeper fast yet an entirely uneventful and drama-free experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to my previous liver cleanse efforts, I knew for a fact that my liver was stone-free and in top condition<br />\r\nso it was ready swiftly to carry out any toxins released during the cleanse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had used the Advanced Parasite cleanse (PWA and PWE, also available at&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com)&nbsp;over the preceding months to take care of&nbsp;any residual parasite aspects. I had&nbsp;in addition done several months of kidney cleanse, six weeks on and six weeks off using a formula that dissolves any residual burden on the kidneys and leave my kidneys working more efficiently, so I knew my kidneys were in good shape to support the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that the key to an uneventful and easy fast is to have all the organs of elimination open and working as well as to be parasite-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I usually start my fast a day or two before leaving home, so that when I hit the road in Thailand I am already well into day two or three of the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the prior preparation, the first few days of the cleanse were a non-event. I experienced zero hunger or urges at any stage in the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the third day, the body&rsquo;s innate wisdom realises that the intake of&nbsp;food has stopped and it switches into house cleaning mode. Over the next few days, the inner wisdom goes about cleaning out toxins, accumulated debris, and a whole bunch of &lsquo;mud&rsquo;. Each day this would be eliminated thanks to the bowel formulae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING TAKES HOLD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Days pass quickly. I spend my mornings swimming in the clear tropical waters, taking long walks on the beach, having a daily skin brush whilst soaking up the sun, as well as a daily Thai massage and the labour of blending and straining my own juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoons, I study Siezhen Energy healing with Jet Lei followed by an hour of Vipassana meditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the seventh day I&rsquo;m feeling&nbsp;the rejuvenating effects of the fast kicking in. The stress and accumulated impressions of my last few months are now forgotten. My body is healing and rejuvenating at record speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seventh day is my last day of the juice fast and for the final three days I would eat whole fruit only as a transition off the fast and return to a normal eating regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending the fast successfully is considerably harder than doing the fast. It&rsquo;s so easy to undo all the good benefits of the fast by a thoughtless meal in the spur of the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits have been great. I awaken fresh and naturally at day break each day. My mind is crystal clear; my meditations are clear and focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could easily have continued on past seven days, but the need to get back to real life and the demands thereof are calling me back to Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results available to us from as little as seven to 14 days of fasting can be miraculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that many religious, mystical and spiritual disciplines call for a forty-day fast. Sadly this given way to the modern quick-fix approach of treating symptoms instead of getting to the cause of the human diseased condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my hope that my experience may inspire you to plan your own personal maintenance time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MALCOLM SLYPER&nbsp;is the founder of Art of Detox, for more information on detoxing and fasting trips, go to&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JUICE FAST ORIGINS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The orange juice method of fasting was originally made famous by Dr. William Hay (1869-1940). A prominent New York surgeon, many years of living the high life had left Dr. Hay excessively overweight and with conditions including kidney disease, high blood pressure and a dilated heart. Having run out of ideas, he turned to nature in a desperate attempt to resolve his situation. His success was modeled on the old orange juice doctors of the late 1800s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His method was simple, entirely natural and cost virtually nothing. Within fourteen days he had turned his health around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of his efforts was a complete remission of symptoms and within three months he had reduced his weight from 225lbs (100kg) to 175lbs (80kg).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So inspired by his results, he then laid down his surgical knife and drugs approach to medicine, and for the next 23 years, used juice fasting to help cure 63,000 patients from around the world with this almost zero cost method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believed that there was&nbsp;not a disease that the fast couldn&rsquo;t empower the body to heal.

(59, 'Can cosmetic surgery make you happier?', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><em>Can cosmetic surgery make you happier? If so, when? And when will it not work? How can you tell? What are the warning signs that almost guarantee you won&rsquo;t be any happier when the scars heal? Words by&nbsp;Tamara Pitelen.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About&nbsp;20 years ago, cosmetic surgery was on the outskirts of acceptable society but it&rsquo;s very quickly gone from something available only to the very rich and very vain, to slap bang in the middle of mainstream society to the point that it&rsquo;s now almost unusual if you haven&rsquo;t had some kind of cosmetic procedure be it anything from Botox and fillers to laser hair removal or a breast enlargement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the holistic community, this can bring quite a moral dilemma. If you&rsquo;re someone who spends time pursuing a deeper comprehension of and connection with the magnitude and intelligence of the universe, it may feel incongruous, even ridiculous, to also be concerned with the shape of your nose or fullness of your breasts. But still you are. Yes, you want to deepen your connection with Creator but you also want to get rid of your eye bags. So what to do with these feelings and beliefs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does cosmetic surgery ever have a justified place? Most people accept that it&rsquo;s right to fix a unsightly deformity on a Nepalese child&rsquo;s face with surgery yet if a woman wants a smaller nose or bigger breasts it&rsquo;s not seen in the same light. However, if a woman with over-sized breasts that give her severe back pain wants a reduction, that&rsquo;s ok. In fact the UK and US armies will pay for their female soldiers to have breast reductions if the breasts hamper their abilities to carry out their duties. And if a person who&rsquo;s been disfigured in a fire or through an acid attack gets repair surgery, that&rsquo;s ok too. Where is the line? Who draws it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SURGERY AND SPIRITUALITY<br />\r\nSome would argue that cosmetic surgery is the manifestation of self- hate. In the 80s and 90s, the feminist movement viewed cosmetic surgery&nbsp;as another tool for oppressing women. The belief was that an anti-women patriarchal society was shoving women into a box that decreed they must not age and they must fulfill the male ideal of female beauty, which dictates large, perky breasts. The feminist view was that keeping women preoccupied and never happy with their appearance was an effective method of control and oppression. You can&rsquo;t take over the world if you&rsquo;re obsessing about the size of your thighs. It was the modern version of Chinese foot-binding and the neck-stretching rings worn by women in African societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not only been the poster child of gender oppression, cosmetic surgery was also lambasted as a tool of racial oppression, for example, when Asian women went under the knife to get more Western-looking almond-shaped eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward to 2014 though and cosmetic surgery is being embraced by men and women of all cultures, social classes and walks of life. So what&rsquo;s going on and can cosmetic surgery be aligned with a spiritual life based on the premise of self-love and acceptance? There&rsquo;s never going to be across the board agreement on this and now there&rsquo;s another angle to consider since the arrival on the scene of an energetic form of cosmetic surgery available through Pranic healing. It&rsquo;s called energetic body sculpting and Pranic energy healing practitioners claim that they can give you fuller breasts or remove that double chin with just the power of energy healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See box out for more information on this but essentially it would suggest that the problem with traditional cosmetic surgery is the method not the end result. Who&rsquo;s to say if Pranic body sculpting actually works but if it did, would that mean altering your body is ok as long as no knives are used? Or is&nbsp;it the permanence that&rsquo;s the problem, in which case laser hair removal is &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; but shaving or waxing is &lsquo;ok&rsquo;? Again, who makes that call?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PLASTIC FANTASTIC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The likelihood is that cosmetic surgery is here to stay and that it&rsquo;s going to get ever more widespread as technology comes up with procedures beyond imagination as well as makes procedures that are currently difficult and costly, quick and cheap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors Maurizio and Roberto Viel are twin brothers and cosmetic surgeons who run a successful practice in Dubai Healthcare City. It&rsquo;s no surprise that they see no moral dilemma in the decision to undertake a cosmetic procedure but it may come as a surprise to learn that the brothers do not believe it&rsquo;s the answer for everybody; that they turn down about 10 per cent of the people who walk through their doors, and that they advocate a holistic approach to taking care of your appearance and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We believe to have a holistic approach is important,&rdquo; Dr Roberto says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only surgery but it&rsquo;s lifestyle, it&rsquo;s good health, good nutrition, regular exercise&hellip; if you want to achieve good long lasting results, you also have to do your part. I<br />\r\nsay to my patients, &lsquo;I do my part, you do your part,&rsquo; so change your lifestyle, stop smoking, stop abusing alcohol, sleep more, leave off the junk food, all of that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just in case you&rsquo;re wondering, neither of the brothers has gone under the knife themselves but Maurizio does have Botox injections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cosmetic surgery is part of a multi-issued approach. Our services are liposuction, facelift, breast augmentation, whatever, but you need also to see that it is a part of a more comprehensive approach to lifestyle changes,&rdquo; Dr Roberto says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctors say that the percentage of male clientele is rising fast. Currently, the breakdown is 70 per cent female to 30 per cent male. They say the most common procedures are, for women, liposuction and breast augmentation, followed by facial rejuvenation. For men, number one is also liposuction, mainly on the waistline and the chest, followed by facial rejuvenation in the way of eyelifts and nose jobs as well as penoplasty (penis enlargement).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The motivations for having the work are the same for both genders, Dr Roberto says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They want to improve something that they don&rsquo;t feel is good for them or they want to look younger and better because of competition in the business world, competition in their profession, or because they will feel better if they look slightly younger. It is the same.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Dr Maurizio, it generally comes down to people wanting to feel more confident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of them are not fighting the aging process however they want to age gracefully. They want to age beautifully, in harmony with what they feel inside. They feel energetic, full of passion for life, they look at themselves and the outside does not reflect the inside and this brings internal fighting. So they want to put that on the same level. There are cases where people are fighting the aging process&nbsp;and they do everything and they go overboard, they exceed normal common sense but the majority of patients are sensible and balanced and have realistic expectations of what they want. They are not fighting the inevitable, they just want to feel better.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors MAURIZIO and ROBERTO VIEL&nbsp;run the London Centre for Aesthetic Surgery, they have offices in Dubai Healthcare City and London, UK.<br />\r\nLCAS Dubai: Tel: +971 4 375 2393 or email&nbsp;Gulf@LCAS.com<br />\r\nLCAS London: Tel: +44 207 636 4272 or email&nbsp;info@LCAS.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.lcas.com&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;IN DEFENCE OF COSMETIC SURGERY &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Katrina Valente, Holistic beautician</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Katrina Valente, age 47, is loud and proud about her cosmetic surgery. Is there a contradiction between her holistic principles and going under the knife? She doesn&rsquo;t believe so&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In&nbsp;a world of people obsessed with chasing after the youth drug, it&rsquo;s hard not to get caught up in it. So what does a spiritual woman like you or me do when we decide that perhaps we&rsquo;d like to have a little &lsquo;work&rsquo; done? Should we love ourselves just the way we are because that&rsquo;s what spirituality teaches us? Or is the anti- surgery movement just as judgmental as any other black or white belief system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Several years ago, I had breast augmentation surgery. It was my birthday presenttomyself. IdiditbecauseIdidn&rsquo;tlike my bust and was tired of looking at myself. I did it because I live in a world where I could do something about it. Ten years later, I still think it&rsquo;s one of the best things I ever did for myself. I&rsquo;ve also being having Botox done for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having the surgery made me feel so much more confident and sexy and my new breasts better suit my frame so I am now in proportion. Is it wrong that altering a part of my body has made me feel more confident? Who&rsquo;s to say? But it did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As a holistic therapist, I&rsquo;ve had people tell me I&rsquo;m a contradiction in terms. I&rsquo;m told&nbsp;I should love myself exactly the way I am, as God made me. Didn&rsquo;t God also make cosmetic surgery? Humans have been tweaking what God gave us for centuries. Men dye their hair and shave their faces while women colour their lips, paint their eyes and shave their legs. We put holes in our ears to hold jewellery, we have ink permanently etched into our skin as tattoos, and the hair removed our bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am also an Aesthetician. My profession and livelihood is based on making the very best of your physical appearance because appearances counts. Within three seconds of meeting someone, we judge and are judged on appearances. I also believe your physicality is a manifestation of your spirit &ndash; an outer view of your inner world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Older women who inspire me are Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Sophia Loren and Raquel Welch who, at 73, looks absolutely phenomenal. Has she had a facelift? Yes, a very good one. I imagine she still feels vibrant and alive and she wants her outer self to reflect that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying cosmetic surgery is always a positive thing and I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s the be all and end all. Taking care of yourself isn&rsquo;t about just physical looks. Other factors that come into play include nutrition, exercise, skincare, sleep, mental health care such as meditation for stress management, and more. If you&rsquo;re smoking two packs a day and living on hamburgers then perhaps some self- reflection might be in order before you head off for liposuction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, each person must take the call on which of the techniques offered by modern technology they would like to take advantage off in order to present the face to the world that they feel best reflects their inner self.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gail Clough, DJ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gail Clough, age 48, had her first procedure at age 17, a nose&nbsp;job. Since then she&rsquo;s had a total of five surgical procedures as well as ongoing non-invasive cosmetic work such as Botox, collagen and fillers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;love how I look now, I don&rsquo;t plan to have any more surgery because I don&rsquo;t need it, I&rsquo;ve done everything I wanted doing. If I could go back in time and speak to my 17-year-old self I would encourage her to go ahead and have the surgery to reduce the size of her nose without any hesitation. It gave me so much more confidence; I&rsquo;d always been self-conscious about my big honker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We live in a world where beauty and youth are commodities, just like intelligence or excellent management skills. We all want to put the very best versions of ourselves forward to get ahead in our careers or to find the best possible partner. Just like you might go back to university to do a Masters degree in order to get ahead at work, I see it as the same when you invest in your appearance through rejuvenation procedures or the altering of something you don&rsquo;t like about your appearance. The most common client is a woman aged about 38 who&rsquo;s had her children and just wants her body parts put back to where they were before the pregnancies and childbirth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The old arguments against cosmetic surgery just aren&rsquo;t valid anymore. How can it be called anti-women with so many men having procedures? The percentage of men having surgery is rising faster than it is for women, men are having liposuction, hair transplants, Botox, penoplasty, eye and brow lifts&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like the old days when a facelift was literally lifting your face! Today&rsquo;s techniques are much more subtle and you can&rsquo;t tell when it&rsquo;s done properly, someone just does look like a better version of themselves. All the Hollywood actresses and models have had excellent work, this includes Jennifer Aniston, Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone and Christie Turlington&hellip; they all look natural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It can be risky though. You have to be careful and do your homework. Don&rsquo;t hurry into it, ask the right questions and even if you&rsquo;re slightly unsure of the surgeons, go and see more clinics to talk to more doctors. And don&rsquo;t think this is going to transform your life in every way, because you&rsquo;ll be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEVEN WARNING SIGNS THAT COSMETIC&nbsp;SURGERY WON&rsquo;T MAKE YOU HAPPIER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When will cosmetic surgery make you happier and when will it not? Can you tell before the scalpel is wielded? This is where the warning signs come in, seven signs that practically guarantee you won&rsquo;t be happy if you have cosmetic surgery. Doctors Maurizio and Roberto Viel reveal the signs that indicate cosmetic surgery is not the answer to your problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 1: Doing the surgery for someone else</strong><br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s say a man prefers large-chested women and his wife is flat-chested. If she gets breast enlargements to please her husband she&rsquo;ll probably end up feeling resentful and angry. &ldquo;If you do the surgery to please someone else or to change your life, or the circumstances in life around you, that is probably not going to be a success,&rdquo; Dr Maurizio says. &ldquo;For me a warning light is if I see a patient and they say, &lsquo;oh doctor I want to impress&nbsp;my husband&rsquo; or &lsquo;I want to find a new husband&rsquo; or &lsquo;I want to have a better social life because all my friends are 20 years younger than me&hellip;&rsquo; these are warning signs that expectations are not realistic. But if you get a patient who says, &lsquo;I am not happy with the size of my breasts and I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable and I can&rsquo;t wear a nice evening gown,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s ok, they will probably be happy with the surgery.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 2:&nbsp;Unrealistic expectations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes we have to say no because of unrealistic expectations or because of psychological issues,&rdquo; Dr Roberto says. &ldquo;For example, if you want to look like someone else or if you want to go from size 16 to a size eight, that&rsquo;s unrealistic. We need to have a proper and achievable goal so if you see this is not possible you must say, &lsquo;sorry I cannot&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 3:&nbsp;When a patient arrives with a photo of a celebrity</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;When the patient comes with photos of some celebrity and they say, &lsquo;I want this kind of body,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I would like to have this kind of face.&rsquo; That is a bad, bad sign,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Roberto says. Again, expectations are unrealistic and probably extend beyond&nbsp;the appearance. Basically, the patient subconsciously wants to be the celebrity and yearns for a fantasy lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 4:&nbsp;Someone who wants drastic change without effort</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a warning sign when a patient says, &lsquo;Doctor, I don&rsquo;t like to exercise, I love my food and I like to sleep, I don&rsquo;t do anything but I want to look like Naomi Campbell and I am five sizes bigger than her&hellip;&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dr Maurizio says. &ldquo;The patient needs to be ready to work on diet, nutrition and exercise.&rdquo; Amazing change can be achieved in six months but not without teamwork between the doctor and patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 5:&nbsp;The patient is having a life crisis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If someone is in the middle of a divorce or grieving the death of a loved one, maybe their parent or partner has died, we probably won&rsquo;t operate on them. We say, &lsquo;take time to heal and come back to see us again in six months time if you still want this work&rsquo;,&rdquo; Dr Maurizio says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 6:&nbsp;Mental health issues</strong><br />\r\nIf a person has an obvious mental illness, perhaps they have depression or are in<br />\r\na manic phase of bipolar disorder, it is obviously better not to operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Warning sign 7:&nbsp;The long-term user</strong><br />\r\nIf someone comes in who&rsquo;s already had a number of surgical procedures but they&rsquo;re still not happy, that&rsquo;s a warning sign that what ails them can&rsquo;t be fixed with more surgery, say the doctors. &ldquo;These are the difficult patients; the patients who will never be happy because they try to find&nbsp;a solution to their problems in changing some body part. We try to avoid this kind of patient, we say, &lsquo;the operation is not a solution for your problem&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PRANIC FACELIFT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just when you thought you&rsquo;d heard everything, Pranic healers are now offering an energetic version of cosmetic surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can energy healing give you a facelift? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s being offered by Pranic healers based in the UAE. One of the brochures reads &lsquo;Facial Rejuvenation with Pure Raw Cosmic Energy! Get a fresh healthy glow, lessen lines, lessen wrinkles, firm and tone up your face with pure raw energy! No needles, no surgical procedures, no pills, no pain!&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s a very big claim, which will no doubt be met with a great deal of skepticism. For a start, how does it work? According to Pranic Energy Healer Harsini Wickramasuriya energy healing works on your invisible energy body or aura, which is the mould of your physical body and which controls the face you present to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If I can change the energy in your energy body then I can affect the physical body. All negative thought forms imprint on the face and in the body. By removing those and helping the client change their thinking and habits, results can be maintained,&rdquo; says Wickramasuriya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She goes on to say that by applying ancient energy healing technology to your face, all energy toxins are removed along with all old, used up and diseased energies. The face is energised and revitalised by adding new radiant cosmic energy. This process accelerates and rejuvenates the facial skin by quickening the renewal and regeneration of cells in the face thereby filling your face with light and lustre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your face reflects your inner state. Energy healing not only remedies the physical and visible features of your face, but most importantly it aims at dissolving the emotional stresses that inevitably reveal themselves on your face in the form of physical imbalances.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How long does it take? You&rsquo;ll need a total of six sessions either twice a week or weekly for facial rejuvenation. A session lasts 90 minutes. Weight-loss and body sculpting takes eight sessions of two hours each and includes treating food cravings, guidance on how to do meditation, fitness and nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curious?&nbsp;Want to try some energetic body sculpting?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Pranic healer Harsini Wickramasuriya discount! is offering a six-session facial rejuvenation&nbsp;package for AED 2,400.

Is the amount of processed sugar in the modern diet responsible for everything from diabetes and obesity to cancer? How difficult is it to cut refined sugar out of your life and what happens if you do? That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming to find out with a two-month low sugar diet. Our low sugar diet will begin in two days on the first of the month. My husband Adrian and I are preparing by doing some research on what we can and can&rsquo;t eat for the next two months. It&rsquo;s been surprising. His whole breakfast needs to change, Adrian always thought he ate a good healthy breakfast, namely a bowl of bran flakes with semi-skimmed milk, a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a strawberry yogurt. It&rsquo;s all got to go! On low- sugar, the idea is that we eat only foods that have between three to five grams of sugar per 100gms and anything we drink has zero grams of sugar per 100gms. The bran flakes have about 20gms of sugar per 100gms, the yogurt has 10gms of sugar per 100gms and the orange juice is basically all sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Adrian ate the whole orange,&nbsp;it would be ok but juicing it is basically like throwing away all the nutrition and fibre and just keeping the sugar, we&rsquo;re told. Who&rsquo;s telling us this? All manner of anti-sugar zealots including David Gillespie, an Australian man who lost 40kgs apparently effortlessly by going low sugar and then wrote a best-selling book about it called&nbsp;Sweet Poison: &nbsp;<em>How sugar makes you fat</em>. Is he right? Juicing zealots like Jason Vale would probably say no but since we&rsquo;re doing the low sugar experiment, we&rsquo;ll take David&rsquo;s advice for now. And he&rsquo;s not the only one. Sugar is the new fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Doctor Mark Hyman says: &ldquo;For years, we&rsquo;ve been brainwashed into thinking that fat causes heart attacks and raises cholesterol, and that sugar is harmless except as a source of empty calories. &ldquo;They are not empty calories. Sugar calories are deadly calories. Sugar causes heart attacks, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and dementia, and is the leading cause of liver failure in America.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a bit horrified at the sugar content of some ordinary foods. Breakfast cereals&nbsp;are ridiculous, just about every cereal on the supermarket shelf is off limits, they&rsquo;re all packed with sugar. The only exceptions are rolled oats and Weet-bix. Soy milk, that&rsquo;s got to go because of the added cane sugar. Cow&rsquo;s milk doesn&rsquo;t agree with me so I&rsquo;m trying goat&rsquo;s milk. Might try almond milk too. So, what&rsquo;s our new low-sugar breakfast? Weet-bix, which has about four grams of sugar per 100gms; full fat milk; full fat natural yogurt, and a wheat-grass shot. On weekends, it&rsquo;s bacon and eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 7</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adrian says his appetite has increased and he&rsquo;s craving coffee. We&rsquo;re told this&nbsp;is normal because when your body wants a sugar hit it&rsquo;ll urge you to have something that it would normally get sugar from &ndash; Adrian doesn&rsquo;t drink much coffee but when he does he always puts in a teaspoon of sugar. Is his body creating a coffee craving to&nbsp;get that teaspoon of sugar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 14</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More disappointments for Adrian today, he&rsquo;s realised he can&rsquo;t have coffee with whitener like Coffee Mate and he can&rsquo;t have the office tea that&rsquo;s made with Rainbow milk nor the so-called diet hot chocolate drinks. They&rsquo;re all loaded with sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weigh in number one, Adrian has lost 2.8kgs and I&rsquo;ve lost 1.4kgs. Crikey. It&rsquo;s almost too easy. Will it continue? We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 22</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoops. We fell off the wagon during a trip to the UK. White crackers, bread, cider, Baileys&hellip; and it&rsquo;s showing on the scales. Almost back to square one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 23</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everywhere I turn these days, I read something else about the evils of sugar. I smell a trend. Fat is apparently coming back into favor. I&rsquo;ve just read an article that claims fat may have nothing to do with heart disease! That it&rsquo;s been wrongly blamed all this time. Poor fat. It was in the 1960s that scientists were scratching their heads trying to explain the alarming rise in heart disease levels. A scientist called Ancel Keys grabbed the headlines by claiming fat was the number one killer. The food industry spied an opportunity and before long our supermarket shelves were swamped with low fat products &ndash; everything from yogurts to mayonnaise, biscuits and desserts. There was one man banging a different drum though, UK Professor John Yudkin who wrote a book called&nbsp;Pure, White and Deadly&nbsp;in 1972. He said the rise in heart disease correlated to the rise in the consumption of sugar. Unfortunately, Yudkin became the target of a powerful sugar industry, he was basically black- listed and discredited by sugar-funded opponents. A more recent anti-sugar militant is Professor Robert Lustig whose Youtube video&nbsp;Sugar: The&nbsp;Bitter Truth&nbsp;has had over four million hits. He&rsquo;s now rehabilitating Yudkin&rsquo;s reputation. It&rsquo;s at a time when obesity rates in the UK are now 10 times what they were in the 70s and the amount of sugar eaten has increased by 31 per cent since 1990 because of the &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; sugar added to products like tomato sauce, soft-drinks, yogurt, baked beans, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 28</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely feeling better somehow &ndash; can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on how I feel better. Wish I could say the weight was falling off though&hellip;&nbsp;<em>to be continued!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Results of the Quit Sugar challenge will be posted here soon.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>QUITTING SUGAR FAQS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I eat fruit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, whole fruit. No, fruit juice. Some recommend that when you first kick sugar, you should go &lsquo;no fruit&rsquo; then introduce it again in a couple of months or at least stick to low sugar fruit like berries, kiwifruit and melon while avoiding the high sugar fruit like grapes, apples and bananas. It&rsquo;s up to you but if you do choose to keep fruit just make sure you eat the fruit, the whole fruit and nothing but the fruit (sorry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I drink milk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Milk is ok as long as you&rsquo;re not intolerant to it but it&rsquo;s got to be full fat milk according to the low-sugar- brigade because skimmed has too much sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this just a low carb diet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. Carbohydrates are fine. In fact you must make sure you get plenty of good carbs like vegetables and whole grains (brown rice, lentils, legumes&hellip;) because that will reduce the cravings for sugary sweets.</p>\r\n', 'sugar-written-in-sugar-1024x608.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:10:12'),
(61, 'Curing the sugar blues', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>Why do you need to quit the sugar habit? For a start, it makes you old, fat and grumpy and that&rsquo;s not all.&nbsp;Basma Saimua&nbsp;reveals why and how to ditch the white stuff.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do&nbsp;you frequently crave sugary foods? Do you gain weight quickly and lose it slowly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you feel tired and low on energy&nbsp;in the afternoons? Do you suffer from insomnia? Does your mood constantly fluctuate? If yes, then you are probably addicted to sugar. You&rsquo;re not alone, most people suffer from this addiction but aren&rsquo;t aware of it, mainly because sugar is not only present in sweets and chocolate &ndash; where you&rsquo;d expect it &ndash; but it&rsquo;s also hidden in hundreds of food products that we consume every day that you might not expect to find large amounts of sugar, such as tomato sauce and mayonnaise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our bodies evolved to survive&nbsp;on small amounts of sugar derived mainly from fruits, vegetable, and grains. Constantly consuming refined sugar can lead to chronic diseases and conditions including obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, hypoglycemia, aging skin, headaches, and migraines. Being free from sugar addiction can significantly improve overall health and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is sugar and when is it bad for us?<br />\r\nNatural and unprocessed sugar is a simple carbohydrate that is digested and absorbed by the body slowly. It is found in whole foods such as fruit, vegetables and beans. In this natural form, sugar is rich in vitamins, minerals and enzymes that also aid in its digestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glucose, which is our body&rsquo;s main source of energy, enters the blood stream at a steady rate providing the body with the ability to sustain itself&nbsp;on this gradual release of energy for a long period of time. In response to the glucose, insulin, which is responsible for carrying the glucose molecules to cells for use as energy, is secreted by the pancreas at a steady rate, allowing the body to use up all the glucose as energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when we consume sugar that has been refined and stripped&nbsp;of all the healthy vitamins, minerals &nbsp;and enzymes, we cause havoc in our bodies. The sugar is broken down&nbsp;very quickly not only using the body&rsquo;s reserves of minerals, vitamins and enzymes to aid in its digestion but also causing a rush of glucose to enter the blood stream; this in turn causes the pancreas to produce a surge of insulin, to take the glucose into cells where</p>\r\n\r\n<p>it will be used for energy &ndash; in other words, stored as fat. The fast release of sugar causes stress on the body and in the long run can lead to chronic disease. Refined sugar is known to most in the form of chocolate, biscuits, cake and sweets but it is also present in breads, ketchup, processed baby food, cereals, fruit drinks, milk products, soda drinks and much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2013 study (1) on the effects of sugar on weight gain, conclude that reducing sugar can have a small but significant impact on weight loss. Walter Willet MD. DR. P.H Nutrition Chair of the department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health commented on the research stating, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that sugar does have adverse effects, particularly in liquid form as sugar-sweetened drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is also a strong body of evidence showing that sugar-sweetened beverages are related to type 2 diabetes. And sugar is not the only issue; there&nbsp;is the bigger problem of carbohydrate quality. Large amounts of refined carbohydrates are also a problem.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor said Willet is the way we consume things, because that affects the physiologic response. &ldquo;For example, eating a whole fruit is much preferable to drinking fruit juice. The sugar in fruit is balanced out by the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ibre and other nutrients and it takes time to be released. When we eat a whole apple or orange, we limit our intake. If you are drinking fruit juice, you might have three or four servings, but you would almost never eat three apples or oranges in a row.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why sugar is addictive</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like an opiate, sugar stimulates the reward centre in our brain&nbsp;so, once we have a taste of it, we unconsciously go back for more. It works on the same pleasure centres that are influenced by taking certain drugs, and quitting the habit causes withdrawal symptoms such as cravings and headaches. A study (2) conducted by the Connecticut College resulted in the conclusion that Oreos, a biscuit full of refined sugars, are as addictive as, and might even be more addictive, than drugs such as cocaine. Joseph Schroeder, the college&rsquo;s Associate Professor of Psychology and Director of the Behavioral Neuroscience Programme, and his students, found that eating Oreo cookies activated more neurons in the brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;pleasure center&rdquo; than exposure to drugs of abuse. The results are preliminary and subject to further scientific review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our research supports the&nbsp;theory that high-fat/high-sugar foods stimulate the brain in the same way that drugs do,&rdquo; Schroeder said. &ldquo;It may explain why some people can&rsquo;t resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study concluded that high sugar foods are to be considered as an addictive substance. Bearing this in mind can help understand why it is so difficult for people to kick the habit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources: 1. &lsquo;Sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain in children and adults&rsquo; http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2013/08/21/ajcn.113.058362.abstract<br />\r\n2. http://www.conncoll.edu/news/news-archive/2013/student-faculty-research-suggests-oreos-can-be-compared-to-drugs-of-abuse-in-lab-rats.htm#.UwS7Q_3j_wI&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FINDING HIDDEN SUGAR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are hundreds of different names of sugar.

Knowing what is considered &lsquo;sugar&rsquo;, reading food labels, knowing all the different names that sugar can take, are just small steps that, if practiced consistently, can yield great results in alleviating sugar cravings. Start with one of the suggestions listed below. Some people might find it takes some time to reduce the cravings, the first week can be the hardest but remember that you have been addicted to sugar for a very long time. Be patient and stick with it, you&rsquo;ll start to feel better slowly. Here&rsquo;s what to eat to detox from sugar while staying satisfied and sane:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat more whole grains and protein-rich foods<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;They&rsquo;re satisfying, keep you full longer and will lessen the sugar cravings.&nbsp;Good sources:&nbsp;Free range eggs, nuts, avocados, olive oil, hummus, salmon or organic chicken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat less refined foods<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;white pasta and white rice which are examples of refined foods, they have been stripped of all their fiber resulting in a very low glycemic index, this causes a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash that will only lead to your bodies need for a quick fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat less meat<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;A diet rich in animal foods can cause an imbalance in our bodies leading to sugar cravings, according to the yin/yang principles of balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t skip meals<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;When your blood sugar gets too low you&rsquo;re more likely to look for a quick, sweet fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat fermented or sour foods<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;Because they&rsquo;re a sugar-craving killer and they add good bacteria back into your intestinal system that can be depleted by a high sugar diet.<br />\r\nGood sources:&nbsp;Sauerkraut and kimchi</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add sweet vegetables to your meals Why:&nbsp;They are naturally sweet so by adding them to your meals you are giving your body a sweet fix that&rsquo;s healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good sources:&nbsp;Sweet potatoes and carrots</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add more vegetables to your meals Why:&nbsp;Leafy greens like kale and spinach, vegetables are complex carbohydrates that will keep you satiated for hours. Plus, lack of nutrients causes imbalance in our bodies and since they&rsquo;re nutrient-intense, adding a good amount of vegetables, will kill cravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercise and move your body<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;Helps balance the sugar levels in the body. Exercise also reduces stress, and at those stressful moments we most likely will turn to a sweet fix to feel better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t go overboard on fruit<br />\r\nWhy:&nbsp;One piece of fruit per day before or after meals is fine but over consumption (eating more than one piece at a time) will cause a spike of blood sugar. It might be better than a teaspoon of the white stuff but the body still uses it as sugar.<br />\r\nGood sources:&nbsp;Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, etc&hellip; berries are low sugar fruit</p>\r\n', 'sugar-lips-1024x736.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:39:47'),
(62, 'Tapping away your troubles', 'body', 'featured', '', '', '', '<p><em>It&rsquo;s called Tapping, EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) and EET (Emotional Empowerment Technique) and it&rsquo;s a way to release negative emotions, fears, phobias and stresses through the stimulation of traditional acupressure points with gentle tapping. Words by&nbsp;Tamara Pitelen.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are&nbsp;you in a state of disease&nbsp;or distress, beset with problems that you can&rsquo;t&nbsp;seem to shake? This could be money, career, family, health, or relationship issues. Or maybe you have a great life but still you walk around in a black cloud, unable to enjoy your many blessings. Perhaps you&rsquo;re often lethargic, depressed, or discontented. These feelings are trying to tell you something and the longer you deny or suppress them with substances like food, alcohol or medication, the stronger they will get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Feelings are basically the language of the soul,&rdquo; said EFT practitioner Monisha Parwani during an Emotional Empowerment Technique Workshop at Dubai wellness centre, The Third Eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our feelings tell us whether or not we are aligned with our true selves and our life path. When we have a positive feeling it means things are going well. Similarly, whenever we have a negative feeling it means we are not in balance; that there&rsquo;s something to look at,&rdquo; Monisha said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your feelings and emotions are your inbuilt compass; your guidance system. Not trusting your feelings, suppressing them or ignoring them leads to dis-ease.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monisha said that any disease on the physical body is the result of a thought process but the happy news is that this can be reversed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENERGY IN MOTION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, what you feel manifests in the physical. To illustrate this with a simple example, if you&rsquo;re embarrassed, you blush. If you&rsquo;re afraid, your heart rate rises and you start sweating; if you&rsquo;re sad, you cry; if you&rsquo;re happy, you laugh or smile, and if you&rsquo;re angry your face turns red, your muscles tighten and your<br />\r\npupils change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you continue to ignore what your soul is communicating to you through your feelings and emotions, that communication will start manifesting in your physical body, at first it could be an ache, rash, itch, pain or twinge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that many of us internalise our feelings because society teaches us there&rsquo;s something wrong with showing emotion so we sweep them under the carpet but does this mean they go away? No, the pile under the carpet just gets bigger and bigger until one day it all spills out like a tidal wave of rubbish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FREQUENCY STATIC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every emotional disturbance is accompanied by a distortion of the corresponding energy channels in the body, says Monisha. These channels have different names in different cultures, including meridians and nÄdi (traditional Indian medicine). These channels allow the energies of the subtle body to flow and they connect at special points of intensity often called chakras. So whenever you feel disturbing or negative energy, the meridians get disturbed. If you allow yourself to feel these emotions, acknowledge them and release them, then the energy lines are returned to the normal state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But supposing you don&rsquo;t release them and a meridian is blocked by a negative emotion so the energy cannot pass through. In that case, there will be a build-up of energy, which, if&nbsp;left unaddressed, could appear in&nbsp;the physical body as an ache or pain. Eventually, it could become a disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Every thought that we have effects our emotions, which affects our energy body, or the chakra body, and that it turn affects our physical body,&rdquo; Monisha said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These unexpressed feelings get stored in the cells of our bodies and from there they enter our DNA. Once they&rsquo;re in your DNA, they can be transferred into the DNA of&nbsp;future children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENERGETIC PLUMBING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can you get these unexpressed feelings out of your cells? Blockages like this in the meridian lines can&nbsp;be released with techniques such as EFT or tapping, acupuncture, Reiki, reflexology, acupressure, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;EFT or tapping is a powerful tool that uses mind-body science for tracing back to the core problem and releasing imbalances in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With EFT, you go into the thought process and change it; make it positive so your physical body can return to a state of balance, to homeostasis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We use tapping and affirmations to release discordant emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety, worry, jealousy, frustration, hatred, greed, tension, depression grief, etc</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With EFT, you tap on the meridian points around your head and torso, while talking out the negative feelings &ndash; do this over and over and the block starts to open and the energy starts to flow again. The reason we talk out the negative feelings first is because you need to bring up the feeling of, say, anger from the cells of your body. You need to feel the emotion by talking it and by tapping on it, and as you are tapping and talking and breathing you are releasing these emotions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRIED AND TESTED &ndash;&nbsp;THE TAPPING EXPERIMENT&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamara Pitelen went along to The Third Eye EET workshop and found herself sobbing in front of strangers&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d already had some experience of tapping so &ndash; despite not really understanding how it works &ndash; I&rsquo;m convinced it can be a very powerful healing technique. To get some more idea of the rationale behind it, I went along for a workshop with EET practitioner Monisha Parwani. After hearing a bit of theory from Monisha, it was time to try it for ourselves. Monisha asked us to think of an issue we&rsquo;d like to work on. I&rsquo;ve done group healing workshops before and on that day I really didn&rsquo;t want to end up bawling like a baby in front of a class of strangers so I decided not to deal with any of my big issues and instead pulled up something I considered fairly &lsquo;safe and small&rsquo;, namely a work client who had made me angry the week before with his unreasonable demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be easy to clear,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;no chance of crying with that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I started tapping on this &lsquo;small&rsquo; issue out loud in front of the class.&nbsp;I began by tapping on the karate chop point of my right hand (left or right hand, it doesn&rsquo;t matter).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I said: &ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m furious at Wissam for his unreasonable demands over the work project, I still completely love and accept myself&hellip;&rdquo; I repeated this several times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, being guided by Monisha, I started moving around the other meridian&nbsp;points of my head and torso, the start of my eyebrow, the outer side of my eye,&nbsp;under my eye, etc. I was saying things like, &ldquo;I am so angry at Wissam, he&rsquo;s a bully.<br />\r\nHe never appreciates what I do for him, his expectations of what can be delivered just get ever more ridiculous, it makes me wild!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I continued tapping on my feelings, digging deeper into them as I moved around the meridian points, I suddenly found myself coming out with stuff about how my stepfather never made me feel appreciated and, yep, there I was crying like a baby&hellip; in front of a class of strangers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power and speed of the technique surprised me. It was also a revelation to discover that my reactions to a situation at work actually stemmed from unresolved childhood anger towards my stepfather. How many other apparently unconnected situations in our current life are in fact rooted in childhood trauma? Most importantly though, crying those tears felt like a release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIY TAPPING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to give tapping a try?

(63, 'The science behind energy healing', 'body', 'featured', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em>How can someone heal you when they&rsquo;re not even touching you? Science is beginning to come up with the answers&hellip;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern&nbsp;existence is built around the work of invisible energies, from the microwave frequencies that cook our food, to the radio frequencies that channel music into our cars and send text messages across the globe in seconds from our telephones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It begs the question whether one day energy healing will seem as miraculous to future humans as sending a fax is today or as wondrous and impossible as an IMAX movie screen would seem to a person from the 16th Century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Energetic healing&rsquo; is an umbrella term for any therapy that manipulates the energy circuits in our physical or subtle bodies to regain balance and facilitate our body&rsquo;s innate healing mechanisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Jim Oschman, co-author of the book&nbsp;Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis,&nbsp;says modern research science<br />\r\nis beginning to shed light on the role of natural &ldquo;energy forces&rdquo; within the human body that were previously thought to be inexplicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested in all the forms of energy and how they interact with living systems, it&rsquo;s nothing mysterious, it&rsquo;s the basic energies that people encounter all the time; heat, light, sound, vibration&hellip;&rdquo; said Dr. Oschman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Energy medicine is medicine based on the appreciation that living systems have energy fields inside of them and around them and that these fields play important roles in physiology, regulatory biology [and]regulating processes that are going on inside the organism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Oschman was inspired to research energy and healing after reading the&nbsp;work of Dr. Harold Saxton Burr, PhD. A member of the faculty of medicine at Yale University for forty-three years until 1956, Dr. Burr discovered that all living things &mdash; from men to mice, from trees to seeds &ndash; are molded and controlled by electro- dynamic fields, which could be measured and mapped with standard voltmeters(1). These &ldquo;fields of life,&rdquo; or L-fields, are the basic blueprints of all life on this planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Burr believed that, since measurements of L-field voltages can reveal physical and mental conditions, doctors should be able to use them to diagnose illness before symptoms develop, and so have a better chance of successful treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy healing is based on the premise that we are all essentially energetic beings. Our bodies vibrate at different individuated frequencies of energy and the different organs and tissues of the body also vibrate at different frequencies within each person&rsquo;s body. The principle of energy healing is that disease results from an imbalance or blockage in our body&rsquo;s vital energy. By removing the blockage or stimulating the flow of energy, our bodies can naturally heal themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy healing modalities include Reiki, Qi Gong, Pranic healing, Tai Chi, Healing Touch, faith healing, acupuncture, Reconnective Healing, Quantum Touch, colour therapy, flower essences, sound healing, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EINSTEIN&rsquo;S VIBES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientific validation that humans comprise more than just the physical body is not a new field of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Theoretical Physicist&nbsp;Albert Einstein who, in the early&nbsp;19th Century, said, &ldquo;everything is vibration&rdquo;. He proposed that everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequencies and is connected by a web of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerning matter, we have been all wrong, Einstein is credited as saying. &ldquo;What we have called matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to be perceptible to the senses. There is no matter.&rdquo; So there is a constant, immutable relationship between mass and energy. Mass is energy and energy is mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the years, physicists have been looking for the building blocks of the universe. First it was the elements (hydrogen, helium, etc), then it was atoms but they split the atom and went on to find ever smaller building blocks of matter such as quarks, leptons, neutrinos, etc. Currently the most basic building blocks known to scientists are &lsquo;strings&rsquo; of energy. These unimaginably small strings vibrate at varying frequencies creating all that we see and experience in our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor of Theoretical Physics Michio Kaku is the co-founder of Field String Theory, he says: &ldquo;The universe is a symphony of vibrating strings&hellip; We are nothing but cosmic music played out on vibrating strings and membranes. Obeying the laws of physics, which is nothing but the laws of harmony of vibrating strings.&rdquo; (2)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIND THE FREQUENCY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, assuming one can accept the concept that we are all energetic beings, it takes another leap to believe that the energies or frequencies that run through us all can be directed, channelled and manipulated for the purpose of healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One person who claims to receive light, information and frequencies through his body and via his hands&nbsp;for healing others is Dr. Eric Pearl, a controversial American chiropractor and a regular on mainstream media in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent visitor to the UAE, Dr. Pearl founded a modality called Reconnective Healing, he says he discovered his ability to heal by accident while running his chiropractic practice in Los Angeles. He says patient after patient would come back reporting healings from cancers, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and other severe health conditions, simply when Dr. Pearl held his hands near them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believes he has energy frequencies running through him that can heal in inexplicable ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People have healings when they interact with this level of consciousness. What seems to be happening is that this brings us into a state of balance that allows our imbalances, which includes our health challenges, to vibrate out of our systems, of our lives,&rdquo; Dr. Pearl said in a television interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Pearl says this is a level of light information that researchers have not seen before and he has been involved in many scientific experiments in an attempt to understand it. He now travels the world teaching others how to access these frequencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are he and others like him performing miracles or are they brilliant frauds, conning a fortune out of the gullible and desperate all over the world? Ultimately, the proof of energy healing is in the pudding. There are thousands upon thousands of anecdotal reports of miraculous and phenomenal healings resulting from the work of healers using light, energy and frequency all over the world. Dismissing this mountain of anecdotal evidence out of hand because the reports cannot be fully explained in a scientist&rsquo;s laboratory would seem obtuse and blinkered in the extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find energy healers based in the UAE, see the Awakenings Holistic Directory atwww.awakeningsme.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sources:<br />\r\n1.

German-origin Barbara was born with the ability to heal by placing her hands on a person or animal. She practiced for 20 years in Germany, working alongside traditional doctors, before moving to Dubai and establishing the Hands In Hope Meditation Centre.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hands-on&nbsp;healing has been around for centuries yet it is still often treated with suspicion by mainstream society and traditional medical practitioners. How can someone heal you when they&rsquo;re not even touching you? This is the concept so hard to accept for anyone raised in a western culture entrenched in surgical cutting-and-burning, prescription medications, and treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For scientists, the issue with energetic healing is that it is difficult to measure and quantify therefore it immediately violates the most basic tenets of serious scientific research. But things are changing. Even science is now confirming that every living and non-living thing has an energy or electrical field or spirit. It is these unseen energies and frequencies that energy healers work with and over the years, I&rsquo;ve had countless alternative and energetic healing sessions from practitioners that span the spectrum of ability. Most recently, I went to see Barbara Jackle, a hands-on healer who&rsquo;s new to Dubai but who worked full-time for 20 years alongside traditional medical practitioners in her home country of Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is quick to make it clear that she does not see energy healing as a substitute for traditional Western medicine, instead she believes the two approaches are complementary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite having been a healer for two decades, Barbara has had no formal training and holds no certificates in healing modalities such as Reiki. Her ability to place her hands on a person and facilitate healing is a gift she was born with although she has developed&nbsp;it over time. Her grandmother had the same ability and was a popular healer in her community. It was Barbara&rsquo;s grandmother who encouraged and taught her how to&nbsp;use the gift. She started when she was a young woman although she had felt the energy since she was a child. She began by practicing on family pets but quickly moved onto humans and in the last 20 years or so Barbara has tackled every kind of health condition including cancer, multiple sclerosis and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what&rsquo;s it like? A session involves lying&nbsp;on your back on a massage-style table. To start, Barbara scans your body with her hands and a metallic dowsing stick that she calls a pendulum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She began by asking me if there was any health issue in particular I wanted to focus on. I said there no, that I was just curious to see what she would find. I didn&rsquo;t tell her anything else. I should mention that before I&rsquo;d even got on to the massage table, Barbara told me my life energy was low and needed a boost. This was true; I&rsquo;ve had ongoing issues with overworked adrenal glands. Once I was on the table, Barbara went around my body pointing out where she immediately found problems, some of these included the very top and bottom discs of my spine and&nbsp;a blocked meridian on the right side of my head. She said I also had some hormonal imbalances (true); a tendency to store stress in my stomach, which caused excessive stomach acid (true), and a slow metabolism and slow detoxification processes, in other words organs like my liver and kidneys were a bit sluggish (true). All of the above had previously been told to me by various traditional medical practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbara spent the next 40 minutes treating me with the energy that comes through her hands and into different areas of my body. From the client&rsquo;s point of view, receiving a treatment is not dissimilar to having a Reiki, Pranic healing or Access Bars Consciousness session. Your job is to lie there and receive. It&rsquo;s extremely relaxing, you&rsquo;ll probably doze off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was impressed that Barbara was so spot on about some of my existing health issues but I was even more impressed that she felt she could do something about them. I was delighted when she said she had sped up my metabolism although<br />\r\nshe also said that keeping it raised might require further treatments as this was a hereditary condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Barbara, the detoxification process after a session lasts three days and in that time it&rsquo;s important to drink lots of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterwards, I sat and chatted with her a little longer but I found it hard to concentrate because I was filled with a lovely, soothing feeling. It sounds odd I know but it was almost like it was caressing me. That wonderful feeling stayed with me all the way on the drive home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Licensed by the Department of Economic Development, the Hands In Hope Meditation Centre LLC opened in Dubai&rsquo;s Jumeirah 1 in September 2013.

External stressors might include a busy work environment and pressure from the boss to meet deadlines or sales targets, getting stuck in traffic when you&rsquo;re already late, screaming children, the phone ringing, etc. Internal stressors might be anxiety about a large family get-together or nagging thoughts of self-doubt or low self-worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens in your body when you&rsquo;re stressed?<br />\r\nYou watched a horror movie last&nbsp;night, it really scared you and triggered the release of adrenaline&nbsp;and cortisol through your body.&nbsp;These chemicals were still in your system this morning when you were out walking so the honking of a car horn had you jump out of your skin. Although the car horn was harmless, your mind perceived this noise as a threat and told your brain to prepare your body to react to the situation. Commonly referred to as the &lsquo;fight or flight response&rsquo;, which is designed to help you deal with danger, your body releases adrenaline and cortisol to help you respond to these perceived threats. The heart, muscles, lungs and brain become the priority for recieving fuel and all the other bodily functions are put on the back burner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our bodies are intelligent and automatically respond to such situations. Adrenaline makes the heart beat faster so it can supply more oxygen to the cells in the body. It also increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and the rate of breathing. The adrenal glands pump out stress hormones like cortisol, which increases the amount of sugar in your bloodstream by blunting the effect of insulin. Insulin helps to maintain a normal blood sugar level in the body. Although there is an increased amount of sugar in the blood (from both increased cortisol and suppressed insulin levels), the sugar is not getting delivered properly to our cells. It&rsquo;s like having a key that unlocks a door, but without someone to use the key, it&rsquo;s useless. Since the body is smart, it recognises the cells are crying out for energy (glucose) and sends hunger signals to the brain. This state of having high blood sugar levels for a prolonged period can lead to strong food cravings, overeating, and weight gain. If our satiety signals are not in tune, we end up eating more and we store as fat any glucose that is not immediately used by the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High levels of cortisol can also compromise one&rsquo;s immune system and therefore reduce the effectiveness of the digestive system, causing indigestion. This is a concern, because even if we are consuming healthy foods, we may not be digesting them properly and absorbing their nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TURN OFF THE FAT SWITCH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper nutrition on a regular basis&nbsp;can help to combat your stress levels. However, the first thing you should&nbsp;do (before turning to food), is find out what is causing your stress. Long-term stress leaves cortisol levels high and then the vicious cycle of having strong food cravings and fat storage starts again. Is stress comes in short, sharp bursts and the body has the chance to return to a normal state, it&rsquo;s fine. The problems appear from long-term, ongoing stress. The hormonal storm caused by prolonged stress can increase your risk of fatigue, adrenal exhaustion, weight gain, blood sugar problems and high blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have managed your stress, you can use food as a support system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5 WAYS TO COMBAT STRESS THROUGH NUTRITION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat regularly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to your hunger cues. Don&rsquo;t let your body get to the point where you feel you could eat two large pizzas. Eating on a regular basis keeps your blood sugar levels more stable, which in turn may prevent strong food cravings and overeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat balanced meals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of food offer different nutrients. Include at least three food groups at each meal and make sure one of them is protein, as it is satiating and can help you to feel more alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat your fats</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn to love fat, it is your friend and ironically the body cannot release excess body fat without certain fats. Walnuts, flaxseed, and fish oils all contain omega 3 fatty acids. These fats may help to improve brain function and decrease feelings of depression or anxiety that sometimes come from prolonged stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drink more water</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably the most important thing you can do to combat stress. Drink water, every day, all day. Stress can cause the body to be dehydrated because when we are scared our metabolisms increase and we naturally sweat. What&rsquo;s worse, being dehydrated can cause stress itself, headaches, feelings of dizziness, and fatigue. So buy an attractive water bottle and carry it with you everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid sugar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching for the quick sugar fix, such as chocolate or baked goods, is one of the worse things you can do when you are stressed. The high amounts of sugar in these sweet snacks combined to the high blood sugar levels from being stressed make the problem even worse and your food cravings even stronger. Not to mention, having prolonged blood sugar levels is also a risk factor for developing Type 2 Diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t use food as&nbsp;a cure for your stress<br />\r\nIt doesn&rsquo;t work; I have tried it many&nbsp;times. The strong food cravings the body experiences are most likely due to the imbalance of hormones from the stress response. Instead, try having a cup of warm tea, going for a walk, or take five deep, long breaths in a calming or private place. If you really want to eat something and feel it will help, I recommend consuming foods that are crunchy. Almonds, carrots, seeds, or celery are almost the equivalent to the relief you get when punching a boxing bag! Give it a try, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work, don&rsquo;t stress about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ALLIE MCLAUGHLIN&nbsp;is Managing Partner of FitnessO2.com.

(65, 'My first sÃ©ance', 'body', 'healing', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em>If you think a s&eacute;ance is all quiet and spooky, think again. In&nbsp;</em>My First Seance<em>, Tamara Pitelen reveals that sitting in a s&eacute;ance can be like going to a nightclub that has a kindergarten in the corner. There&rsquo;s music, laughter, lots of noise&hellip; and of course plenty of dead people.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may have just chatted with a dead person for the very first time. I don&rsquo;t mean an imaginary discussion in my head. This was an out-loud, two-way conversation with a dead person &ndash; or to put it less bluntly, a person from spirit world. My dead conversationalist was Daniel, a Cockney boy of about nine years old. More on what we talked about in a second; first, let me backtrack to explain how I ended up sitting with a group of people trying to communicate with the dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IS THERE ANYBODY THERE?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before tonight, I&rsquo;d thought a s&eacute;ance involved very serious people sitting quietly round a table earnestly asking, &lsquo;is there anybody there?&rsquo; in a spooky voice. Turns out it&rsquo;s more like going to a nightclub that has a kindergarten in the corner. There&rsquo;s a lot of music, laughter, banter and noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s suspend disbelief for a moment and accept that what I perceived was real. If so, I had spirit children spray me with water from a little water pistol and I watched as these spirit children played with fluorescent toys, making them seemingly dance by themselves in the darkness. These little spirit children also stood (or hovered) at my knee, serenading me as only a six-year-old with a drum can. All ear-splitting vigour, not much rhythm. The spirit children in our midst bashed away on toy pianos, blew harmonicas, banged drums, and rang bells as loudly as they could. Meanwhile myself and about 40 other people sat on chairs in a big circle, all holding hands and singing at the top of our voices along with the child musicians. We belted out songs by Abba, Bon Jovi, One Direction, The Carpenters, Don McLean, Louis Armstrong, Tina Turner and more. Why? The idea is that all the loud singing both lifts our vibrations and raises the energy in the room, which makes it easier for the spirit people to come into our reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOGWARTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The s&eacute;ance I just attended was part of a week-long mediumship training course at the Arthur Findlay College for the Advancement of Psychic Studies in Stansted, London. Yes, it is like being a boarder at Hogwarts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what happens at a s&eacute;ance and how does it happen? First, you need a physical medium. This is a person who has the ability to allow spirit people to use his or her body to have a presence in this world &ndash; that presence can be heard or seen by everyone present, whether they have psychic abilities or not. I can vouch for the fact that everyone of the 40 or so people in the s&eacute;ance &ndash; aka &lsquo;sitters&rsquo; &ndash; could hear the spirit people talk and sing and play the various instruments that had been left out for them to play with. The physical medium at the Arthur Findlay College is Scott Milligan, 31, who&rsquo;s been working as a physical medium for about 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole process took about four hours. The first half hour was the preparation lecture where we all sat in another room and Scott told us what we might expect as well as the dos and don&rsquo;ts. It is a very serious business, this s&eacute;ance sitting. If sitters don&rsquo;t follow the rules, the medium can be seriously hurt, even killed. Why is it dangerous? Because we&rsquo;re all energetically linked during a s&eacute;ance and he can effectively be burnt or electrocuted. Scott described it as if he was at the centre of a spider&rsquo;s web and each of us were at the outside end of a strand. Any movement at the outer edge of the web vibrated through to the centre. He told us about a good friend of his, also a physical medium, who couldn&rsquo;t eat for two weeks after his esophagus was burnt at a s&eacute;ance where a sitter stood up suddenly, jerked forward and vomited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common question is, why does the s&eacute;ance have to take place in total darkness? In this case, it&rsquo;s because of the level of Scott&rsquo;s development as a physical medium. His aim is to eventually be able to hold a s&eacute;ance in the light and to advance to the point where spirit people can actually manifest in solid form through him but he&rsquo;s not ready for that yet and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold a deep trance state for up to three hours with all the lights on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FRAUD POLICE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is quite a procedure to go through before the s&eacute;ance commences. This is to counter any &lsquo;hoax&rsquo; accusations before they come. Of course though, such accusations are inevitable no matter what lengths the mediums go to to show it&rsquo;s all real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, two &lsquo;independents&rsquo; are chosen from our group &ndash; it&rsquo;s their job to uncover any fraudulent behaviour. For example, they must check the s&eacute;ance room for anything suspicious, like a team of actors hiding behind the curtain or hidden doors, as well as check the chair to which the medium gets tied. Then they actually tie him to the chair with plastic fasteners and throughout the evening, they check he&rsquo;s still securely fastened. The independents cut the ends of the plastic ties off when they&rsquo;ve secured Scott and they keep them in their pockets for verification that, at the end of the s&eacute;ance, the ties on Scott&rsquo;s wrists and ankles are the same ones as at the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the duration of the s&eacute;ance, Scott is strapped to the chair by his hands, arms, feet and legs, all to prove he could not be manipulating anything. Unless he has Houdini-like talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The independents are chosen during the preparation speech. Scott asks two people to stand with their backs to the group and throw a scrunched up paper ball over their shoulders at the class in the same way a bride would throw her bouquet. Whoever catches the paper balls are the independents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we moved into the s&eacute;ance room, which in this case is the Arthur Findlay College library, a large room lined with a circle of chairs. Before we can go in though, we are frisked. You may take nothing into the room other than the clothes you&rsquo;re wearing. No phones, no jewellery apart from wedding rings, no bags, etc. Shoes are left at the door</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even where you sit in the room is decided by lucky draw. Each chair has a slip of paper with a number on it. A bucket contains a pile of slips with corresponding numbers, you take a number from the bucket and find the chair with the matching number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, I ended up in a chair up the front near all the action. I was a couple of metres from where Scott was tied to the chair and placed inside a large three-sided cabinet &ndash; that is, it had no front. Also sitting in the circle were three of the college tutors, Kitty, Eileen and Maureen. It&rsquo;s their job to keep Scott safe; to keep the sitters calm, and to ensure proceedings flow smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All over the floor in front of the cabinet are children&rsquo;s toys and musical instruments, deliberately put there by humans for the spirit children to play with. There was a Daffy Duck stuffed toy, a teddy bear, two small water pistols, a child&rsquo;s plastic xylophone, several drums, a large bell, a harmonica, a ball, a tambourine, skipping rope, a couple of funnel-like trumpets and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HIGH SPIRITS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once everyone is in their seats and the medium is settled in the cabinet, we all holds hands and the lights go off. That&rsquo;s when the music starts. During the first two songs, one of which was&nbsp;<em>Starry, Starry Nights</em>&nbsp;by Don McLean, we&rsquo;re told to keep quiet while Scott goes into the altered trance state that allows the spirit people to use his body and energy to enter our world. Very few people have this ability, physical mediums are a rare breed. Just being your regular run-of-the-mill, talk-to-dead-people medium doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re able to do physical mediumship. The spirit world has told Scott he can do it because of a &ldquo;defect in your brain&rdquo;, UK medium Colin Fry is another one with the ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the third song, the tutors Maureen and Eileen tell the group that Scott is in the trance and we all now need to sing loudly and vigorously to build up the energy and vibration that the spirit world needs to move into our world and do things like pick up the toys, bang the drums and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won&rsquo;t lie. I&rsquo;m nervous. We&rsquo;re sitting in absolute pitch black with only a sliver of light from the flourescent toys visible. Everyone is holding hands and we&rsquo;ve been told to call out and name and shame anyone who breaks the circle, the idea is to ensure that no living person can get up and move the toys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About half way through singing the first song, gasps are heard around the room as the fluorescent toys start moving. Not just moving randomly though, they&rsquo;re dancing around in time with the music then one by one dumped on the ground &ndash; just like as if a child has got bored with them, which is exactly what&rsquo;s happening according to the tutors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WAKE THE DEAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, it&rsquo;s like a circus has kicked off around my feet. Drums are loudly banged, tamborines are shaken and the xylophone is played. &ldquo;Excellent drumming! What great rhythm! Thank you,&rdquo; people call out to encourage the little spirit musicians to keep playing. Next, people around me are gasping that they&rsquo;re being sprayed with water and then I feel it too, a little squirt of water hitting my knee. Soon, people are saying that they can feel and see little fingers touching their shoulders, legs and hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m nervous. I don&rsquo;t want to be touched by spirit children so in my head I ask that they leave me alone. We were told in the preparation lecture that this would be effective. It seemed to work, I wasn&rsquo;t touched at all during the s&eacute;ance even though both of the women sitting either side of me felt the little fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, a young Cockney voice can be heard out of the dark. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello duckie,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;y&rsquo;alright?&rdquo; This is Daniel, one of Scott&rsquo;s spirit helpers (they don&rsquo;t like being called guides apparently, they&rsquo;d rather you called them &lsquo;spirit friends&rsquo; or &lsquo;helpers&rsquo;). Daniel presents himself as a boy for his work with Scott but in fact he was aged in his fifties when he died. Daniel was fond of a drink while on earth but one night as he was leaving the pub he slipped and fell, hitting his head. Unfortunately, because he was a well-known drinker, people just left him on pavement because they thought he was passed out on alcohol. Next thing he knew, his mother was standing over him. &ldquo;What are you doing here Mum? You&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Yes, and now you are too,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Come on, come with me&hellip;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott says that Daniel presents as a boy so that people can better relate to him. Not everyone has been 56 but most people have been the age of nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel is the spirit control who helps the spirits on the other side to communicate with a living person in the room. One of the other spirit children was a little girl that Daniel nicknamed Scrapface, he told us she was in training to do the job of being a control spirit for a physical medium who hasn&rsquo;t been born yet. Daniel is showing her the ropes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While chatting, one of the group asks Daniel &ndash; for some reason &ndash; if there are fish in spirit world. &ldquo;Of course there are,&rdquo; Daniel replies before going on to tell us that everything that lives in our world ends up in his world, including fish and flowers. Daniel is the link between the two worlds because it is apparently extremely difficult for the spirit people to alter their vibration and energy to the degree required to be heard or seen in our world. This is something we&rsquo;d witness for ourselves before the night was over but first there is even freakier stuff for the novice s&eacute;ance attendee to get their head around. Ectoplasm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOTALLY ECTOPLASMIC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard of it if you&rsquo;ve ever seen any of those freaky spiritualist photos from the 1900s. Ectoplasm is the white cotton-wool looking substance that apparently comes out of the medium&rsquo;s body. In the photos, ectoplasm looks static, as if the person is trying to swallow a tablecloth but in fact, Scott tells us, ectoplasm is in constant motion during a s&eacute;ance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ectoplasm is the substance used by the spirit world to show their faces to us and it&rsquo;s the stuff that is used by spirit to create a voice box that hangs in the air not far from the medium. The ectoplasm voice box is used by the loved ones in spirit to talk to their living relatives because, apparently, not all spirits are like Daniel, they are unable to lower their vibrations enough to be heard in our world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the week&rsquo;s course at the College, I&rsquo;d thought ectoplasm was something that had been discredited last century as the stuff of frauds. No, turns out it&rsquo;s alive and well in the world of modern physical mediumship. Ectoplasm itself has even been scientifically analysed. It&rsquo;s made up of various substances that can be found in the human body, which can include red and white blood cells, stomach lining, semen and menstrual blood, as well as matter from the nearby environment such as carpet fibres. Ectoplasm exudes from the body of the medium from any orifice, this could be nose, ears, genitals, belly button and mouth, etc. Apparently, if it comes out of the belly button it smells like boiled cabbage. After the spirit world has retreated, the substance goes back into the body of the medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FRIENDLY GHOSTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point in the proceedings, a woman called Cathleen who was sat one over from me asked Daniel a question:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cathleen: &ldquo;Daniel, can you see us, even in the dark? What do we look like to you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;Yes Duckie, I can see you, you look like ghosts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not scared of us?&rdquo; [I was joking but Daniel didn&rsquo;t seem to realise.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;No, course not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;How come we can&rsquo;t see you if you can see us?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t raise your vibration high enough but I can lower my vibration to meet you. I see you as light and colours.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cathleen tried to ask more questions but Daniel apologised and said he had to concentrate on moving the huge cabinet that had Scott in it, tethered to a chair. To move that cabinet, complete with Scott, would take about eight or so living people all working in unison. Even then I can&rsquo;t imagine it being done without a fair bit of commotion, stumbling and creaking. But that cabinet moved several feet &ndash; apparently without physical effort, in pitch black darkness and completely silently. When the lights came on at the end of the night, Scott was now in the middle of the room but still tied to the chair and the cabinet had also been shifted about five feet. This is the kind of proof of the spirit world that spirits like to provide through physical mediums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AFTERLIFE EVIDENCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main point of a s&eacute;ance though, is for someone to talk to a loved one who has passed over. Forget the dancing toys and water pistols, the real reason for holding a s&eacute;ance is to provide evidence of an afterlife and to give comfort or closure to living people still grieving for dead loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel introduces the spirit who wants to talk to someone in the group, he starts describing her in the hope that one of the 40 sitters in the room will recognise and claim the spirit person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got big glasses,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and her face went very rosy towards the end. She lost her marbles, she&rsquo;s telling me her thoughts were not her own&hellip; when she had her full bag though she was quite a quick wit, this lady.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A woman named Carol down the far end of the room says she thinks she might know this spirit person. Daniel continues, &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s telling me you were in two minds about coming tonight,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You almost decided to give it a miss,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s telling me you felt her this afternoon&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just about dinner time,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah Duckie, she was the little voice in your head telling you you had to come tonight. She&rsquo;s telling me you&rsquo;ve got the photos in a carrier bag,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s saying they&rsquo;re in the cupboard, in like a supermarket bag&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Umm&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel in a theatrical whisper reports back to the spirit person: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re bleeding talkin&rsquo; abaht, there&rsquo;s no use telling me stuff she don&rsquo;t know&hellip; [a pause before Daniel turns back to Carol], she&rsquo;s telling me you do have them Duckie.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I do, I do have the photos in a bag in the cupboard. Sorry, you&rsquo;ve got a dozy one!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nah, you ain&rsquo;t dozy Duckie, I put you on the spot. She&rsquo;s saying someone&rsquo;s still got one of her perfume bottles,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my mum.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s saying that you&rsquo;ve had quite a bit of strife this year,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That the proverbial muck has hit the fan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s very true.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel goes on to talk about letters that Carol&rsquo;s aunt wrote in 1976 and where they were as well as newspaper clippings that that family were holding onto as well as a photo of the aunt wearing a fascinator and gloves that Carol had recently been looking at. All the information was confirmed by Carol and she mentions that the medication her aunt was on before she died had caused her face to turn bright red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it was time for Carol&rsquo;s aunt to attempt to speak to her niece herself, using the voice box that had apparently formed from the ectoplasm exuding from Scott. I couldn&rsquo;t see this in the pitch black darkness of the room, it&rsquo;s what Scott had told us happens in the preparation lecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Shove yer face innit,&rdquo; Daniel said in a loud whisper to the spirit person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goading her,&rdquo; Daniel explains to the living people in the room, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s having a bit of trouble with it so I&rsquo;m teasing her she can&rsquo;t do it and she&rsquo;s taking it as a challenge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when we hear labored breathing, wheezing and the kind of noise you&rsquo;d expect to hear from an old person who is having difficulty forming words. The tutors tell Carol to speak to her aunt to encourage her, which is when we discover that the spirit aunt must be French because Carol, a woman from the Channel Islands with a strong English accent, suddenly starts speaking French to the disembodied voice of her dead aunt. I didn&rsquo;t catch all of the conversation but the gist of it was something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Tu peux venir Tante&hellip; Je sais c&rsquo;est difficile pour toi&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Ca va bien?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit Aunty Therese: Ca va. C&rsquo;est pas mal ici.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Je t&rsquo;adore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit Aunty Therese: Bisou [kiss, kiss, kiss kiss]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also heard from Scott&rsquo;s two other spirit helpers including Eric, an older man with a distinguished British accent as well as Morning Star, a native American Indian who spoke half in English and half in his native tongue. Their voices swirled through the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half way through the s&eacute;ance, there was a brief pause while the red light was turned on and the independents were asked to inspect Scott&rsquo;s fastenings. He was still secured to the chair. I should mention that we can all still hear Daniel&rsquo;s Cockney accent chatting away in the air while the checking of Scott is taking place. Scott is not speaking, he remains in a half trance. It was also a surprise to see that the toys that had started the evening all neatly in one place were now strewn across the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCEPTICS AND SPIRITUALISTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of it all my head was spinning. Did I really just chat with dead people from the spirit world? Did spirit children play musical instruments in front of me, attempting to keep the beat along with our raucous rendition of &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my life&rsquo; by Bon Jovi? And if they did, was it a little insensitive to be belting out lines like, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna live forever, I&rsquo;m just gonna live while I&rsquo;m alive&hellip;&rsquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do I do with this experience now? Either I believe it all happened and it was as real as it seems or, if that is just too outlandish for my brain to cope with, I can dismiss it all as some extremely elaborate hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it that physical mediumship is just so far out in left-field for most people that it&rsquo;s put in the, &ldquo;nah, it just can&rsquo;t be true, that&rsquo;s too insane for my brain to cope with so I&rsquo;m going to ignore it, la la la la la&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve tried describing the experience to friends and family in the wake of my week at the Arthur Findlay College and I can hear the words sounding ridiculous as they come out my mouth. And I see in the eyes of whoever I&rsquo;m talking to betray their thoughts, which range from, &lsquo;wow, she&rsquo;s unbelievably gullible&hellip;&rsquo; to &lsquo;Nah, can&rsquo;t be true, it&rsquo;s a big hoax,&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo;s utterly ridiculous&rsquo;. A couple of people have tried to keep an open mind but even my husband leans on the side of I&rsquo;ve been bamboozled somehow. His theory is Scott must be some kind of Houdini meets Dynamo character and that a team of people trained in moving silently, all wearing night vision goggles, must be responsible for playing with all the toys and shifting the cabinet with Scott in it. A couple of them must be actors, he reasons, to do the voices of the various spirits we hear in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who hasn&rsquo;t experienced physical mediumship for dismissing it all as a load of rubbish. And without question, there have been fraudster mediums in the past so Spiritualism &ndash; which is an official religion &ndash; does have some bad PR to overcome. However, the Spiritualist community isn&rsquo;t that interested in trying to prove anything to skeptics. If someone is determined not to believe, no amount of evidence will ever be enough, my tutor Maureen tells me. The mediums who tutor at the college are weary of people who are only interested in attending a s&eacute;ance to prove it&rsquo;s a hoax instead of focusing on the messages of love from Spirit and pondering for a minute how it might change their life and outlook if they did know for sure that there is an afterlife; that death is an illusion. For Spiritualists, the aim of all their work is to facilitate communication between this world and the next in order to bring comfort and hope to the souls on both sides who are grieving loved ones or have things left unsaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was there. It was a privilege to experience it and I sincerely thank everyone at the Arthur Findlay College for making it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My first s&eacute;ance by Tamara Pitelen</strong></p>\r\n', 'friendly-ghosts.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:40:27'),
(66, 'Extreme detox Thailand', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>For a short-cut back to wellness, Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa in Koh Samui offers a comprehensive detox programme. Tamara Pitelen tried it out.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s my job to find the poo poo; I am the poo poo hunter,&rdquo; said Aor, my Thai therapist, as she vigorously massaged my stomach and kept a close eye on a see-through tube to see if any of the desired &ldquo;poo poo&rdquo; was in fact coming out of me. Along with my other therapist, Wailuka, Aor gave little cries of glee when the &ldquo;poo poo&rdquo; did emerge. These women were serious about their work. For those not familiar with the joys of colon hydrotherapy, you are essentially hooked up to a machine via a tube up your bottom through which litres of distilled water are used to flush out your large intestine in order to remove anything that shouldn&rsquo;t be there, eg, impacted fecal matter, parasites, candida spores, harmful bacteria&hellip; It was the first of three colon hydrotherapy treatments I was having as part of my seven day Comprehensive Detox programme at Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa in Koh Samui, Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I HEART DETOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband Adrian and I had turned ourselves over to the expert hands of Kamalaya&rsquo;s team of therapists and health practitioners in the hope they could help us reverse the effects of the so-called &lsquo;good living&rsquo; that&rsquo;s prevalent in Dubai. Essentially this means high stress jobs, social lives that revolve around all-you-can-eat-and-drink affairs, too much coffee, sugars, bread, meat and processed foods. It had left us bloated and pudgy with sluggish, overloaded systems, bad skin, dull eyes, and digestive issues such as constipation and acid reflux. Most of the time we could kid ourselves that we generally ate well and exercised just enough, but the truth was becoming very evident in the stomachs hanging over waist-bands and the appearance of extra chins. We were not shining examples of health. So, off to Kamalaya for seven days of extreme, take-no-prisoners wellness. On your first morning, you get a full body analysis which even tells you how hydrated your cells are followed by a wellness consultation with the therapist who will work out your plan for the week based on your goals. My plan involved a vegetable-based detox diet (forget any hope of clapping eyes on coffee, sugar, alcohol, or the &lsquo;whites&rsquo; like bread and pasta if you&rsquo;re detoxing at Kamalaya) and several therapies a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOTTOMS UP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings me back to the joys of colon hydrotherapy. Who on earth came up with such a bizarre concept? The Egyptians apparently. In the 5th Century BC, Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, wrote: &ldquo;The Egyptians clear themselves on three consecutive days, every month, seeking after health by emetics and enemas for they think that all disease comes to man from his food.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s it like? That varies from person to person. I&rsquo;ve heard some people find colonic irrigation no problem at all; they skip out afterwards like they&rsquo;ve been reborn. This was not us. For me, the first of the three was the most uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s the releasing of trapped wind that can bring the most discomfort but when your therapist tells you that a great deal of very old, dried poo poo is being dislodged, getting rid of that is worth the minor discomfort. But it&rsquo;s not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. My husband Adrian described himself as &ldquo;traumatised&rdquo; after his first colonic, vowing to never ever repeat the &ldquo;horrific was happy to weigh a kilo less afterwards. So why, you may ask, do people submit to this? Thanks to the modern diet of highly processed foods, the traditional and natural method of eliminating foods is often overwhelmed which is why so many of us suffer constipation, bloating, gas, flatulence and other delightful side effects of a dodgy digestive system. A course of colonics is like an internal spring clean. The primary benefit is, according to Kamalaya&rsquo;s detox booklet, &ldquo;the elimination of toxins and accumulated waste from the colon, thereby relieving stress on the liver.&rdquo; This can lead to benefits ranging from natural weight loss to improved lymphatic and liver function as well as that intangible overall sense of wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAUNA AND SUPPLEMENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What else does a Comprehensive Detox at Kamalaya entail? As well as the colon hydrotherapy, a busy schedule of daily therapies includes Chi Nei Tsang aka stomach massage, lymphatic drainage, Thai massage, and a daily sit in the Farinfrared (FIR) sauna. Not like a traditional sauna, a FIR sauna uses a narrow band of energy produced by the sun that is responsible for photosynthesis. Invisible to the human eye, these rays penetrate much deeper than a regular sauna in order to accelerate healing and release toxins. According to the Kamalaya information pack, &ldquo;studies have shown that most people have between 400 to 800 chemical residues stored in their fat deposits. It is the chemical load stored just below the skin that is the main area targeted by FIR rays. At 43.3 degrees Celsius, fat deposits become water soluble and can be disposed of via perspiration&hellip; a single sauna session of 30 minutes can burn up to 600 calories.&rdquo; Bring it on then! But that&rsquo;s just the therapies. In addition to the daily treatments you also follow a detox diet that&rsquo;s basically vegetables (prepared with amazing creativity &ndash; from pumpkin and coconut curry to juices, smoothies and herbal teas) supplemented with protein shakes, coconut water and a total of 31 supplements taken every day, throughout the day. This cocktail of supplements are specifically designed to support the detox pathways and the liver as it gets on with the job of putting out the rubbish that you&rsquo;ve been storing in your cells. They include vitamins C and E, magnesium, zinc, chromium, selenium, lipoic acid, lecithin, fish oil, probiotics, turmeric, milk thistle, dandelion, schizandra, globe artichoke, psyllium husk and flaxseed. Not to mention daily shots of wheatgrass and homeopathic detox medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOXIC WASTE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They did warn us that the first two or three days would be the worst. As your body is chucking off the toxins as fast as it can, you can suffer a number of symptoms such as headaches, flu-like symptoms, depression and weepiness, low energy and fatigue, restlessness and irritability, to name just a few. I suffered all of the above to a greater or lesser degree. One of the greater degrees was the headaches, that very first night I had a pounding, killer headache. A little man on the right side of my brain banging away at the inside of my skull with a sledgehammer. He carried on into the next day but he was clearly getting weary because the pounding did get weaker until on day three it stopped. Day two was also the climax of the lethargy attack. Kamalaya offers a host of optional activities throughout the day, walking, yoga, cardio classes, cooking workshops, spirituality talks&hellip; but I had no energy for anything but reading and sleeping. Happily, the Kamalaya library is a welcoming haven of calm. I settled in on the sofa and read for hours between therapies and meals. Or I would take my book poolside or beachside to alternate between reading and relaxing in the sunwarmed waters. It was all pure heaven. For anyone living the Dubai dream, life is a non-stop whirl of busy-ness. So the opportunity to be completely cared for in the lush, tropical beauty of Koh Samui is blissful. I was told that most of Kamalaya&rsquo;s business is repeat; people who&rsquo;ve been and then go back again and again. This is no surprise to us. We&rsquo;re already talking about going back next year. By the end of the week, I was two kilos lighter, my skin was noticeably clear (acne is one of my issues), my eyes were brighter and whiter and I felt 100 per cent better than I did on day one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IN A NUTSHELL: KAMALAYA COMPREHENSIVE DETOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s included during a seven-day comprehensive detox programme at Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa (nine and 14 day packages also available): w Accommodation and full board (three Kamalaya meals per day, &agrave; la carte or set detox menu) w All beverages, excluding imported drinks and alcohol w 1 x Body Bio-impedance Analysis (BIA) w 1 x Initial Wellness Consultation w 1 x 90 minute Vital Essence Oil Massage w 1 x 90 minute Traditional Thai Massage w Detox Herbal Remedies and Supplements w 3 x 60 minute Chi Nei Tsang (Taoist abdominal massage) w 6 x 30 minute Far Infrared Sauna w 3 x 60 minute Colon Hydrotherapy w 3 x 90 minute Lymphatic Drainage Therapy w 1 x 60 minute Oriental Herbal Detoxifying Body Scrub and Wrap w Use of steam cavern, swimming, plunge pools and fitness centre w Complimentary attendance to scheduled daily holistic fitness activities w One wellness gift pack and round-trip airport transfers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information, email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@kamalaya.com\">info@kamalaya.com</a>&nbsp;Tel: +66 (0) 77 429 800 Fax: +66 (0) 77 429 899</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addresss: 102/9 Moo 3, Laem Set Road, Na-Muang Koh Samui, Suratthani 84140 Thailand</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kamalaya.com/\">www.kamalaya.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KAMALAYA also offers a yoga programme, a weight-loss programme, a relax and rejuvenate programme, a stress and burn-out programme, and a sleep enhancement programme.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kamalaya.com/\">www.kamalaya.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extreme detox Thailand</p>\r\n', 'kamalaya.wellness_01.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:40:14');

Awakenings investigates cruelty-free cosmetics UAE&hellip; words by Tamara Pitelen and Katrina Valente.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re typical women who love make-up. We love how a new lipstick can make us feel like a million dollars and we love how mascara can make all the difference when we mean business with our eyelash fluttering. We don&rsquo;t, however, believe that some poor little animal has to be tortured and killed in the name of safety testing to create our beloved beauty products. Happily, parts of the world are coming round to the same idea. In March this year, the European Union finally banned animal tested cosmetics after a long battle waged by groups like Cruelty Free International, the British Union for Abolition of Animal Vivisection (BUAV) and The Body Shop. But the fight still goes on, more than 80 per cent of the world still allows animal testing for cosmetics products and ingredients. Worse, with the rapidly rising wealthy middle-class in China, global corporations are falling over themselves to sell to Chinese women &ndash; unfortunately China is the one country in the world where the government actually insists on animal testing so some companies that did have cruelty-free status, have now gone back on this in order to sell into China. This includes companies like Estee Lauder and Avon. There is a glimmer of hope though. On 6 November 2013, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration proposed to abolish the requirement for animal testing for cosmetics and domestic products such as shampoo, skincare or perfume from June 2014. Instead it proposes that industry cont. overleaf should now have the option to assess the safety of a substance based on the toxicological profile of ingredients, similar to the Cosmetic Product Safety Report under the EU Cosmetic Regulations. A definite and gratifying breakthrough but it&rsquo;s not enough. Happily, while we wait for all cosmetic companies to embrace cruelty-free, many cosmetic manufacturers are sticking by their belief that animals don&rsquo;t need to suffer so women can have lipstick. We&rsquo;ve compiled some of the brands and stockists that are available here in the UAE but if you know of any others that we haven&rsquo;t mentioned, let us know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email the information to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:tamara@awakeningsme\">tamara@awakeningsme</a>. com, we&rsquo;ll put this list on the Awakenings website (<a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/\">www.awakeningsme.com</a>) and keep adding to it when we find new cruelty-free products. For this article, we&rsquo;re dealing with cosmetics only, in future articles we&rsquo;ll look at skincare, hair and body care, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. NEALS YARD REMEDIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This company gets a big gold-star for its commitment to cruelty-free cosmetics. NYR owner Peter Kindersley is committed to creating products that don&rsquo;t harm the planet or the beautiful, sentient beings we share it with. Traditionally more focused on skincare, the really good news for animal-loving beauty queens is that in 2013, NYR launched a cruelty-free, organic range of cosmetics in the UAE that includes eye and brow liner, eye-shadow, eye make-up remover, lipstick and lipgloss, foundation, bronzer and more. In addition, NYR recently added mascara to the range that will be available in the UAE first quarter of 2014 (this took longer to develop because NYR found it difficult to source a recyclable wand, bless them).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy it: NYR has outlets in Dubai at Wafi Mall, Sun, Level 1 (04 324 5141); Dubai Mall, Level 1 near Nayomi (04 325 3154); Dubai Marina Mall (050 189 3191); coming soon to Town Centre Springs. Sharjah locations: Sahara Centre, Sharjah (06 554 6702)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abu Dhabi locations: Fatouh al Khair Mall (02 628 9044) and Al Wahda Mall extension, unit E239 Second Floor</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nealsyardremedies.ae/\">www.nealsyardremedies.ae</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. TOO FACED COSMETICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cruelty-free brand stocked by Sephora, Too Faced is super glam, gorgeous and fun. The range has everything you need for day and evening looks. We love the Lip Injection for lip plumping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;contacted Too Faced to check their cruelty free credentials, here&rsquo;s what Juli Jones, Regulatory &amp; International Compliancy Manager for Too Faced told us: &ldquo;Our cruelty-free statement includes all individual ingredients as well as the finished goods. Our cosmetics brushes are also synthetic (no animal hair) and many of our products are vegan friendly (absolutely no animal derived ingredients at all).&rdquo; So, go and buy Too Faced products from Sephora with a clear conscience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy it: Sephora has outlets at Dubai Marina Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Mirdif City Centre, Deira City Centre, Citywalk Al Wasl, Dubai Festival City, and Abu Dhabi Mall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sephora-me.com/\">www.sephora-me.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. DR. HAUSCHKA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the official line: &ldquo;Dr. Hauschka Skin Care opposes animal testing. We neither perform nor commission animal testing of our products or ingredients. Compliance with the European ban on animal testing of cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients is verified during certification of our products as Natural and/or Organic Cosmetics according to the BDIH and/or NATRUE standards.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Products include eyeshadow, mascara, eyeliners, lipliner, lipstick, lipgloss, foundation, concealer, face powder, rouge, bronzer, brushes, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy it: Dr. Hauschka is stocked at Holland &amp; Barrett, The Organic Foods and Cafe, The Change Initiative, Life Pharmacy, and The Nutrition Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.drhauschka.com/\">www.drhauschka.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. THE BODY SHOP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still feel cheated about L&rsquo;Oreal buying Body Shop but as a brand Body Shop is staying true to its cruelty-free principles and was a driving force of the campaign to ban animal testing for cosmetics in the European Union. In 1993, led by it&rsquo;s founder the late Dame Anita Roddick, Body Shop was the first beauty company to take action on animal testing by enlisting the support of its customers across Europe to support the ban. After a twenty year campaign, the EU banned animal testing on cosmetics in March this year. Next stop, the world. At the end of October, Body Shop presented the Cruelty Free International pledge to governments and regulators calling for a global ban on animal testing in cosmetics. Buy it: The Body Shop has outlets in Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Ajman. For your nearest store, check the website or call the head office on 06 530 22 27.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thebodyshop.ae/\">www.thebodyshop.ae</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. MARKS AND SPENCER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We already love Marks &amp; Spencer for so many reasons, their undies, their food hall&hellip; now there&rsquo;s another reason. M&amp;S are loud and proud on cruelty-free cosmetics. This is what they state on their website: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t test any of our M&amp;S beauty or household products on animals. We guarantee that none of the individual ingredients in our beauty or household products is tested on animals either, starting from a fixed cut-off date of January 2006. &ldquo;This covers more than 1,200 products and, more importantly, their individual ingredients, from lavender laundry liquid to tea tree face wipes. All these products have the stamp of approval from Cruelty Free International.&rdquo; Thanks Marksy, we&rsquo;ll be in your make-up section very soon.

ILLAMASQUA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Champions of creativity, edgy British make-up brand Illamasqua is about individuality. The brand takes its inspiration from members of the &lsquo;alternative scenes&rsquo; for whom self-expression is paramount. This is what Illamasqua says about animal testing: &ldquo;Illamasqua products have NEVER and will NEVER be tested on animals. As such we don&rsquo;t support or permit animal testing on any of our products, and only work with suppliers who uphold these principles.

Here are some of the common misconceptions&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 1: A product that says &lsquo;Cruelty-Free&rsquo; or has a bunny on it, hasn&rsquo;t been tested on animals. Not true sadly, the devil is often in the details. Designation as &lsquo;cruelty-free&rsquo; or &lsquo;not tested on animals&rsquo;, or even the image of a bunny on a label may only refer to the finished product, when in fact, most animal testing occurs at the ingredient level. Furthermore, while a company may claim, &lsquo;We do not test on animals,&rsquo; it could still contract other companies to do the testing. The only way to be 100 per cent certain a company is cruelty-free is to buy products from companies that have been certified by the Leaping Bunny Program, which requires that no new animal testing be used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or ingredient suppliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 2: If a product isn&rsquo;t tested on animals, it might not be safe for humans. Utter rubbish. There are many reliable alternatives to animal testing, including cell and tissue cultures and sophisticated computer and mathematical models. Companies can also formulate products using ingredients already determined to be safe. Cruelty-free companies can use a combination of methods to ensure safety, such as employing in vitro tests and/or conducting clinical studies on humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 3: It&rsquo;s hard to find products that really are cruelty free. No, you just need to do a little research.

(68, 'The Zen of Eating', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', 'weight-loss', '', '<p><em>Forget fast food and instant gratification, eating should be a sacred act that nourishes the soul as well as the body. So, where have we gone wrong?&nbsp;<strong>Neha Jamani</strong>&nbsp;explains the zen of eating.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ancient yogis from many traditions considered eating to be a sacred act, where one living part of nature integrates into another living being. In stark contrast, eating seems to be anything but sacred in our fast-food age. For many, eating today has devolved into a purely physical act to provide sustenance for the body &mdash; but definitely not for the soul. The start of a new year is a traditional time to reevaluate your life and health so you might be contemplating improving your diet in 2014. Perhaps you&rsquo;re facing a health crisis or some sort of spiritual awakening that involves taking more care on how what you eat impacts you and the planet; or maybe you are in a new relationship and just want to feel and look better for your partner. Whatever your motivation, you&rsquo;ve decided to eat in a healthier or a more ethical way but sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll probably realise that &lsquo;improving&rsquo; your diet is not as straightforward as you imagined. Buy any book on diet or nutrition and you will find plenty of persuasive advice on what you &lsquo;should&rsquo; and &lsquo;should not&rsquo; eat. Pick another book and you&rsquo;ll find equally convincing advice contradicting the first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAT CHANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many mainstream books on nutrition advise us to limit our intake of fat, yet an increasingly prominent minority contends that traditional animal fats are good for us. One diet may push honey as a superfood; another says it&rsquo;s just as harmful as any other sugar. Some experts say supplements are absolutely essential for good health, while others contend they just give you &lsquo;expensive pee&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll discover that there are diets based on religion, ethics, nutritional philosophy, anthropology, cleansing, the seasons and even blood types. The health food explorer is faced with a bewildering range of contradictory advice all coming from seemingly authoritative sources. Choose rightly: you will be saved! Choose wrongly: you will land in health hell. How do you navigate correctly through these choices? You can choose a nutritional trend and follow it &mdash; with all that such a choice entails. Or, instead of trusting any outside authority, you can go down the path of self-directed dietary exploration and experimentation with your food choices. This way, you learn to trust your body and senses while choosing how to eat wisely. But how can you trust your body when it often seems to lead you astray with unwise food choices because of an apparent lack of willpower?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LANGUAGE OF CRAVINGS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a society, we from the misleading idea of not having enough willpower when it comes to eating. How else can we explain destructive dietary patterns when we fully know the consequences of poor eating choices? How else can we justify bingeing after a week of regimented eating? We incorrectly blame poor dietary choices on &lsquo;weak willpower&rsquo; &ndash; which then leads to an internal conflict over what we &lsquo;should&rsquo; and &lsquo;should not&rsquo; eat. When it comes to food, we think that what we want must be &lsquo;bad&rsquo; or indulgent. Therefore, we believe we need strong willpower to enforce &lsquo;better&rsquo; behaviour. This constant reliance on willpower reveals a profound distrust of our natural ability to make good food choices intuitively. Craving certain foods can be seen as our body&rsquo;s way of signaling nutritional imbalances. It is also well documented that in times of high stress we use food to fill in voids or to mask deeper issues. In these cases, our body is communicating to us in a language we might not understand &mdash; or even recognise as a language. We need to stop seeing the body as the enemy but rather listen to the messages encoded in the language of cravings, appetites and food preferences. Instead of second-guessing what our bodies need, why not tune into the language our body is speaking? Through these messages, our body communicates its physical and emotional needs. One of the ways we can understand the body&rsquo;s needs is to create a quiet internal space in which we can tune in to the cues given in our cravings and appetites. By using a Zen approach to eating, we can create that quiet space within. You might ask, &lsquo;What is Zen eating?&rsquo; In brief, Zen eating is a practice of eating thoughtfully, mindfully and in a state of gratitude. The tips below are designed to help you create this mindful space within, each time you sit down to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9 TIPS FOR ZEN EATING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breathe.</strong>&nbsp;Before you tuck into your meal, take three deep breaths to clear your energy and come into the present moment with gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contemplate.</strong>&nbsp;Observe a moment of silence. A good exercise is to reflect on how your food got to your plate. Think about the people involved in the production, processing, transportation and preparation of your meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chew and Taste.</strong>&nbsp;Devote your attention to the physical act of biting, chewing and swallowing your food. Fully experience and enjoy each bite. Notice the aromas, textures, tastes and temperature of each dish. Through this practice, you may discover new flavors or evoke memories connected to the taste and smells of your food. Paying attention gives you the opportunity to fully know what you&rsquo;re eating and opens up a direct channel of communication with your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat meals in a peaceful setting.</strong>&nbsp;Be it your table at home or a quiet spot in the office cafeteria, choose a peaceful space. You may feel you rarely have the &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; to devote your attention to fully enjoying your food or finding peaceful spaces to eat. In reality, this should not be a luxury, but a necessary part of your meal. As you start a practice of Zen eating, take small steps to integrate this practice into your routine. Have just one meal a day in a peaceful setting, if it is too difficult to do this practice for each and every meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go device-free at mealtimes.</strong>&nbsp;Ditch the multi-tasking while you eat. Stay away from the phone, television and the computer at mealtime. Focus on what&rsquo;s on your plate and engage in conversations with your dining companions. Or just be with yourself and your food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be patient.</strong>&nbsp;You cannot expect to gain instant understanding of your body&rsquo;s messages. Be patient while you learn the language your body speaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Distinguish appetites from cravings.</strong>&nbsp;Pause and ask yourself: &ldquo;Am I really hungry or am I just trying to change my emotions?&rdquo; Is my body calling for sustenance? Or do I simply crave a specific taste?&rdquo; As you become more fluent in your body&rsquo;s language, you will become more able to distinguish between appetite and craving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat food close to its natural state.</strong>&nbsp;In our fast-paced society, we depend a lot on processed and ready to eat foods, which are loaded with additives. By choosing foods that are as close to their natural state as possible, we can keep our choices simple and more healthful. As food writer Michael Pollan advises, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat anything your grandmother wouldn&rsquo;t recognise as food.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be dogmatic.</strong>&nbsp;People often feel wonderful on a special diet for a short time, but that great feeling of wellbeing doesn&rsquo;t always last. Cleansing diets such as veganism, raw foods or juicing bring great short-term results but cannot sustain the body&rsquo;s long term and changing nutritional requirements. Be flexible in your food philosophies rather than feeling that you must become a hardcore adherent of any one &ldquo;diet.&rdquo; You may struggle with this at first but with practice Zen eating becomes natural and pleasurable. While there is a lot of conflicting information out there, listening to your body will guide you towards a way of eating that&rsquo;s right for you. This practice allows you to come into alignment with what you need, what you crave, and what you actually eat. The Zen of eating enables you to honour your body&rsquo;s authentic needs and lovingly nurture your soul through mindful eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>NEHA JAMANI, the founder of The Sacred Kitchen, is a therapeutic and holistic chef.

Awakenings magazine sat down with intuitive energy healer Seda Goksel to get a lesson in cords and cutting them. Words by Tamara Pitelen.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the most non-spiritual person can usually accept the idea that humans form attachments to each other. The &lsquo;ties that bind&rsquo;, &lsquo;tying the knot&rsquo; or the &lsquo;bonds of love&rsquo; are old terms used to describe these types of emotional connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s your friends, siblings, parents, or children, we all create emotional or energetic connections to others and many believe this doesn&rsquo;t only happen between people but that&nbsp;we also create connections to animals, habits, emotional patterns, money, belief systems, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it&rsquo;s natural to form these attachments, it&rsquo;s not always in your best interest, says Seda Goksel, Dubai-based Hypnotherapist and intuitive Energy Healer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cords to and from others drain their energy and ours. Detach those cords and people can again take responsibility for their lives and use their energy for their own growth and evolvement. Cutting cords enhances our relationships and brings more happiness into our lives.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are these cords real things that can&rsquo;t&nbsp;be seen with the naked eye or are they metaphorical cords that just exist in our minds? That depends on your belief system&nbsp;but in fact it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether you think they&rsquo;re real or not. Whether you believe it&rsquo;s an imagined connection or a real attachment, cutting these cords can be beneficial and&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a technique&nbsp;that clinical hypnotherapists often&nbsp;use to free a person from a disturbing memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what&rsquo;s it all about? Awakenings magazine asked Seda to give us an introduction for beginners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics;&nbsp;what are energetic cords or attachments?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>SG:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;When I see cords on a client, they can appear in different forms. Sometimes I see them as a rope, sometimes I see them as pins stuck in people or perhaps&nbsp;a sword in someone&rsquo;s heart because they have had their heart broken. The sword is attached to a cord from the other person. I&rsquo;ve also seen attachments appear as leeches or splinters on people. There&nbsp;are two kinds of cords, those that others have attached to you and those that you have attached&nbsp;to others.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do we only have these&nbsp;cords between important people in&nbsp;our lives?<br />\r\nSG:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;No, an energetic cord is automatically&nbsp;formed with every person or situation in&nbsp;your life, even people sitting next to you in a&nbsp;cafe. I believe we also have cords with past lives partners,&nbsp;memories and traumas. For example, let&rsquo;s say you can&rsquo;t move forward in life because when you were young you were left traumatised by a very bad car accident so now whenever you get into a car to drive somewhere you get this sense of anxiety or a panic attack but you&rsquo;re not sure why. It&rsquo;s a cord to&nbsp;the trauma.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Even with relationships, say you&rsquo;ve&nbsp;been in a relationship and this former partner used to emotionally abuse you. Now, every time you get in a relationship you put a wall up because you are afraid that the next person will do the same thing. This is because you have cords attached to these past relationships so what we do is cut all the negative cords so you can move forward. Cutting cords is basically helping you move forward.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So basically, we&rsquo;re all absolutely covered in energetic cords to all sorts of situations and people?<br />\r\nSG:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes and you have positive cords and negative cords so when we do a cord cutting we only cut away the negative cords. I believe that some people have attachments because they need to learn a lesson in this life so when I do cord cutting I ask that only those cords be cut that do not serve you in your highest good, in other words I let God decide what goes and what stays.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you describe how these negatives cords effect us?<br />\r\nSG:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The attachment is holding you back. Imagine that someone has put a ball and chain around your ankle, would you be able to move forward with ease? No, it&rsquo;s the same with energetic cords. Or maybe your hands are tied but your feet are free so you are still moving but you get the sense of being limited. If I see the attachments as leeches sucking your blood that shows me that your energy is being drained.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does it ever go wrong?<br />\r\nSG:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t really go wrong although I did have a client who came to me for a cord cutting and the next day he texted that he had to see me urgently because after the cord cutting he&rsquo;d had lower back pain that was so intense he couldn&rsquo;t sleep. So he came to me for Reiki and I saw that we hadn&rsquo;t healed the area where the cord had been cut so I gave him Reiki healing and after that he was fine. So it&rsquo;s very important to heal where the cords are cut.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But surely there are millions of people who go through life never getting any cords cut? They don&rsquo;t seem any worse off than those who do. Can cords be cut naturally without any effort?<br />\r\nSG:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;re doing any of the hundreds of healing modalities available &ndash; from counseling to hypnotherapy, Reiki&hellip; even just a good cry with a close friend, that can also break off attachments that no longer serve you. But if someone never does anything to get rid of whatever issue is holding them back, then they can spend their lives repeating the same patterns and getting ever more bitter because they don&rsquo;t understand why they can&rsquo;t find a partner, or never get promoted, or can&rsquo;t stand up to a bully in their life, whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HOW TO GET YOUR CORDS CUT</strong><br />\r\nSo you want to try cord cutting? There are many approaches that fall into two categories, Do It Yourself or Hire a Professional. You can get someone else to do it for you, for example, a hypnotherapist or an energy healer who practices a modality like Theta Healing, Reiki, or Spiritual Response Therapy. To find a therapist in the UAE, see the Listings directory in the back pages of this magazine or go to the Holistic Directory at www.awakeningsme.com.<br />\r\nTo make an appointment with Seda Goksel, email sedagoksel@hotmail.com.<br />\r\nFor the DIY approach, here are some suggestions:<br />\r\nGuided meditation: Go to www.youtube.com and search &lsquo;cord cutting meditation&rsquo;. There are countless videos that will guide you through the process. Play a few till you find one you like.<br />\r\nDIY cord cutting: If you&rsquo;d like to try it yourself, here is a summary of the process as described by Clinical Hypnotherapist Katherine Zimmerman (www.trancetime.com):</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Get relaxed and turn your attention inward or drop into a state of hypnosis<br />\r\n* Imagine standing behind your body<br />\r\n* See or feel a &ldquo;cord/s&rdquo; running into your body along the back<br />\r\n* Trace the cord to its source. Who or what is at the other end?<br />\r\n* If you have anything to say to this person, express yourself fully.<br />\r\n* When the dialogue is complete, pull the cord out of you and the other person/event and<br />\r\nsend the person/event away.<br />\r\n* Dispose of the cord (burn it, bury it, send it to the sun)<br />\r\n* Fill in the opening where the &ldquo;cord&rdquo; was attached to you with a colour that feels good.<br />\r\n* Imagine standing in front of your body and repeat the sequence.<br />\r\n* Notice how you feel physically, emotionally and mentally. Imagine yourself in the<br />\r\nfuture. What is possible now that hasn&rsquo;t been possible before?</p>\r\n', 'woman-face-wrapped-rope-b-w-copy2-1024x534.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:40:56'),

Well I have now! This is a pampering sanctuary for women needing some self-nurturing, a little stress relief, a special pampering treat, or, of course, expert luxury skin care. One detail I love about Sisters is the in-house caf&eacute; where you can relax with a cuppa and magazine. However, it&rsquo;s the treatments that are the speciality and I was there to try out one of the four new Organic Pharmacy signature facials (available exclusively at Sisters flagship branch at The Dubai Mall), namely the Rose Crystal Lymphatic Facial. It&rsquo;s an hour and 30 minutes or so of total bliss with the bonus of knowing you&rsquo;re supporting an ethical brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOXIN-FREE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Organic Pharmacy is a leading British brand dedicated to organic health and beauty. Founded by husband and wife team Margo and Francesco Marrone, it offers sustainable and ecologically-sound premium products and treatments free of the toxic ingredients found in mainstream cosmetics and health products. So far so eco-good but how was the facial? Absolutely wonderful. First, Carrot Butter Cleanser is applied to soften and decongest the skin, followed by a complexion brightening flower petal exfoliation. Three separate masks of seaweed, honey and jasmine were applied before my therapist used rose crystals to decongest my lymphatic system. I was deeply cleansed, steamed, scrubbed, massaged and rubbed. I had my skin analysed, advice given and my blackheads extracted. Finally, I had an acupressure massage to firm my facial muscles because, aside from using pure and potent organic products, the treatments also incorporate massage techniques, lymphatic drainage and acupressure massage to support the skin&rsquo;s ability to heal itself. It all felt amazing and my skin looked fantastic by the end of it all. Fine lines had vanished or decreased, my skin looked more youthful and smoother. I felt refreshed and looked younger, which is, ultimately, the whole point of having facials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SISTERS BEAUTY LOUNGE is offering The Organic Pharmacy&rsquo;s four signature treatments, namely: Rose Crystal Lymphatic Facial for re-energised, glowing skin; Vitamin C &amp; Papaya Enzyme Peel Facial, which targets pigmentation and uneven spots; Solution Facial for Combination Skin, a deep-cleansing facial and, Back Detox Facial.

(71, 'Beginnerâ€™s guide to No Shampoo', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><strong>Heard of the &lsquo;no poo&rsquo; or &lsquo;no shampoo&rsquo; movement? People across the world are dumping store-bought shampoo and conditioner in favour of making their own. Why bother? To free yourself from daily hair-washing; to reduce the toxic load on your body and on</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>the planet. And to save money. Aspen Aman investigates&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would anyone want to give up shampoo? What&rsquo;s wrong with shampoo? This is a&nbsp;good question, especially for anyone who&rsquo;s already using organic and cruelty-free products in an effort to be as &lsquo;green&rsquo; and eco-conscious as possible. For a start, the environmental impact of going shampoo and conditioner-free is a compelling reason, since the product going down the drain is just baking soda and vinegar as opposed to a cocktail of chemicals that they need to be removed at the waste treatment plant in order for the water to be released back into the environment &ndash; this process takes huge amounts of water, not great when you live in a desert that already has huge challenges with water scarcity. Then there&rsquo;s the bazillions of tonnes of plastic waste generated by our global obsession with daily hair-washing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, a large no-poo movement is already gaining traction&nbsp;all over the world. These people have opted to forego shampoo and shampoo, instead making their own hair wash and conditioning products from the traditional cleansing ingredients your great-grandma used to use like baking soda &ndash; aka bicarbonate of soda, water and vinegar. You&rsquo;ll spend as much in a year as you would on one bottle of organic shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the environmental reasons, many &lsquo;no-poo&rsquo; or &lsquo;shampoo free&rsquo; converts also believe it&rsquo;s better for your health. Anything you put on your skin and scalp gets into your blood stream within seconds and from there it can be taken through your organs to every part of your body. That&rsquo;s why pregnant women stop dyeing their hair &ndash; for fear of their unborn child being harmed by colouring chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why else would you try no-poo? Some no-poo-ers say their hair got healthier, fuller and more vibrant than it was when they removed the artificial (and toxic)&nbsp;chemicals. Some people experience reduction of dandruff, psoriasis and other scalp issues when they go no-poo. Others report improved hair growth and reduced hair-fall since the scalp and hair follicles become healthier when chemical-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not going to pretend it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;a challenge initially though. It takes at least 30 days for your hair to adjust to not being stripped of all its natural oils every day so for a while it will still pump out excessive amounts of oil &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get the greasies in other words but it&rsquo;s ok, there are natural remedies. Of course, if you try no-poo and don&rsquo;t like it, go back to your commercial shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO POO STARTER KIT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>So you&rsquo;re thinking about giving no-poo a try? Here&rsquo;s what you need:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Baking Soda (any brand will do) &bull; Distilled White Vinegar (fine/oily-prone hair) &bull; OR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Apple Cider Vinegar (curly/ dryness-prone hair)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Castile Soap (can buy at the Organic Supermarket)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Equipment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A squeeze-bottle or old shampoo/ conditioner bottle for baking soda/ water cleanser</li>\r\n	<li>A good spray bottle for vinegar rinse</li>\r\n	<li>Measuring cup and some&nbsp;measuring spoons</li>\r\n	<li>A funnel for putting baking soda&nbsp;into squeeze bottle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Helpful Stuff</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A &lsquo;before&rsquo; picture showing the condition of your hair</li>\r\n	<li>Bathroom-safe (i.e. BPA-free plastic) storage containers for your baking soda and vinegar mixes</li>\r\n	<li>Spices like cinnamon sticks, star anise and/or vanilla pods for vinegar rinse</li>\r\n	<li>Essential oil (for very dry, not oily, tresses)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Basic Cleansing Formula (your homemade shampoo)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no-poo, your new shampoo is basically just a mix of baking soda and water (filtered or mineral). The ratio is roughly one teaspoon of baking soda per cup (250mls) of water.&nbsp;Remember baking soda is NOT baking powder!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will end up playing around with this ratio in the first few weeks of no-poo. In the first few weeks of de-toxing, oily hair days, you&rsquo;ll probably want a higher proportion of baking soda to water mixture. Somewhere in about week three, you&rsquo;ll find that your hair may be trending towards dryness at the ends, which means you need to step down the ratio of baking soda to water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Squirt the baking soda/water cleanser mixture all along the hairline and on the crown of the head. These are the oiliest areas. Don&rsquo;t squirt the cleanser on the ends of the hair &ndash; it will dry them out. Gently massage the mixture into your hair and scalp. You will not get lather but may find your hair as a bit of a slippery feel to it. In all cases, rinsing well is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to how your hair feels each day during this detox transition&nbsp;period. Be prepared to experiment because this is a process of you getting your hair back to its natural state and learning what is best for your hair and preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expert Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Use Castile Soap (available at organic food stores in Dubai) diluted&nbsp;in water about once a week if you want to help cleanse the oily hair more thoroughly. In highly diluted ratios, this is a great solution for people with real oily scalp issues during the detox; also good if you have sweaty/dirty hair after a workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Basic Conditioning Formula</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember this little rule of thumb: Cleanser on the scalp and roots of hair, conditioner on the lengths and ends. Cleanser on the ends will dry your hair out over time (just like with commercial shampoo, by the way) and conditioner on the scalp will create oiliness/ heaviness (ditto for conditioner).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fine/Oily-prone hair: Distilled white vinegar and water &ndash; in a distilled solution. Try straight vinegar as a rinse, but will probably arrive at a highly diluted solution (mine is about 50/50 white vinegar/water solution) that smoothes the hair shaft after washing but doesn&rsquo;t weigh the hair down.Curly/dryness-prone hair: Apple&nbsp;cider vinegar and water &ndash; in a distilled solution. Just like the fine/oily-prone folks, you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a distilled solution but the ratio may be more like 70 per cent vinegar to 30 per cent water. But, like everything no-poo, you&rsquo;ll be learning what is best for your individual needs by trial and (few) errors. In both cases, finish off your hair with&nbsp;a cool/cold water rinse to close the hair cuticle. This reduces frizz and oiliness. Some people like adding a few drops of essential oil to their vinegar rinse to reduce the vinegar smell and give more moisture to the hair. Do this carefully as a little essential oil goes a long way in your hair. Also, your hair will not smell like vinegar with no-poo. Some people find a faint whiff of vinegar&nbsp;on day one and two but not longer, as your hair quickly adjusts to the vinegar rinse and doesn&rsquo;t absorb the odour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BATTLING THE GREASIES</strong>During the inevitable first month detox period of going no-poo when you&rsquo;re transitioning away from chemical-based shampoo/conditioner, your hair may get very oily. Here are a few tips on how to combat the greasies:1. Adjust the ratio of baking soda (aka bicarbonate of soda) to water in the cleansing solution. Start with one tablespoon baking soda to one cup water. If your hair is not getting clean, increase to roughly two tablespoons of baking soda to one cup of water. You should only need to have this higher ratio of baking soda for about two weeks while your hair is seriously detoxing and giving you the greasies.2. If you are desperate to combat severe greasies during the first week or two, try the baking soda paste method. Put a quantity of baking soda into your palm, add water and then rub into the scalp &ndash; especially around the hairline, over the ears and on the crown of the head where the scalp tends to get oiliest. Let the paste be an emergency remedy rather than your no-poo routine.3. Add a squirt of all-natural Castile soap in the baking soda/water solution for an extra shot of cleaning on the first week. You can adjust it to adding the squirt of Castile soap if/ when needed.4. If you have fine, limp or prone-to-oily hair, don&rsquo;t use the apple cider vinegar. Instead, use regular white vinegar. You may find that a ratio of 50:50 water/vinegar works for your hair &ndash; or even more diluted solutions of vinegar with water. Experiment until you find what works for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. As a general rule, people with oily or fine hair won&rsquo;t need to apply the vinegar rinse to the roots &ndash; especially during the greasies detox period. Use a spray bottle to spritz the vinegar rinse exactly where it is needed. Too much vinegar solution equals heavy, greasy hair at this stage of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Use the DIY dry shampoo as a touch-up later in the day if your hair is just too oily to tolerate. Cornstarch is better for light coloured hair while a cocoa/cornstarch mix is better for darker hair. The cornstarch/cocoa is a 1:1 ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Experiment: You&rsquo;ll need to note (mentally or by writing down your notes) how your hair is reacting to the baking soda/water cleanser and the vinegar rinse &ndash; and just give yourself a few weeks to get through this stage by playing around with the solutions and the dry shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHEMICAL NASTIES IN YOUR SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brief overview of some of the most commonly-used chemicals in commercial shampoos and conditioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, a.k.a. SLS and SLES: These are&nbsp;the foaming agents that make you think your hair is clean even though the foam does not do any cleaning. SLS/SLES have been linked to carcinogenic activity in the body and can also cause genetic mutation, skin/eye irritation and disruption of the body&rsquo;s endocrine system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Parabens: This is a whole family of chemicals ending with the suffix &lsquo;paraben&rsquo;. Parabens have been described as &ldquo;estrogen mimicker&rdquo; which means that they send signals to the body that is similar to estrogen, which can lead to hormonal imbalances in women and men as well as increased risk of some cancers. Look for methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben or any other chemical ending in &lsquo;paraben&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Quaternium-15: A preservative that releases formaldehyde into the body.

(72, 'Holistic anti-aging secrets', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Beauty therapist Katrina Valente reveals her personal secret weapons when it comes to holistic anti-aging.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlhough I&rsquo;ve studied and qualified in just about every beauty therapy you&rsquo;d care to name, when it comes to anti-aging, I remain an advocate of holistic therapies. I&rsquo;ve always led a pretty healthy lifestyle. I&rsquo;ve never smoked, I&nbsp;don&rsquo;t drink that much and have exercised regularly for the best part of 25 years. I&rsquo;m no saint though, I eat healthily most of the time but sugar remains my main vice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both from my own experience of how best to hold back the signs of aging, as well as what I&rsquo;ve seen from thousands of clients, I&rsquo;ve come to various conclusions regarding the secrets of staying healthy and young in body, mind and spirit. Here are my top tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOOD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost in importance is what you&rsquo;re feeding your body. I&rsquo;m a great believer in detoxing and eating natural foods, raw where possible. I make a fresh juice every morning. Vegetable juices are better than fruit as the latter is high in sugar, natural sugars granted but it&rsquo;s still sugar!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favourite mix is carrot, cucumber, celery, beetroot, lemon, apple and ginger. A few hours later I have a protein shake&nbsp;made with vegan protein powder, coconut water, two tablespoons of coconut oil, Chai powder and nuts, all blended together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grass-fed organic beef is great for the female hormonal system and is high in iron and the good fatty acids that are essential for aging gracefully. Quality, organic beef is very different from a McDonald&rsquo;s burger so go ahead and eat home-cooked organic beef once or twice per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home-made soups are very high&nbsp;in nutritional value, easy to make and delicious at any time of the day. Stay away from starchy carbs in the evenings and fill up on vegetables; your energy will soar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been exercising consistently for about 25 years now. I personally like a firm body so weight-training has always been important to me but my advice is that&nbsp;as we get older we need to change our routines. After two decades of hardcore weight training, I&rsquo;ve recently been doing the Tracey Anderson workout and I&nbsp;love it! It&rsquo;s an updated version of the old Callanetics that was all the rage in the 80s. Yoga and Pilates are a wonderful way to keep supple, lean and flexible as we get older. For downloadable workout videos, go to www.tracyandersonmethod.com or www.laurakateaustralia.com for a fusion of body resistance, yoga, fitball, balance and aerobic paced moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WATER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water keeps our systems ticking over and prevents toxic build up. Our bodies are 85 per cent water so if we don&rsquo;t have enough to keep our organs functioning properly, we experience constipation, bloating and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For good quality water, I recommend Jebel Akhdar Natural Mineral Water from the mountains of Oman or Fiji Water. Both are high vibration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shop online at www.organicfoodsandcafe.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SKINCARE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another biggie for anti-aging. Prevention is better than cure so the earlier you start taking care of your skin, the better. Professional products are the best as they contain more active ingredients that work on the deeper layers of the dermis where<br />\r\nall the collagen and elastin is formed. An interesting fact is that whatever you buy over the counter at your chemist or supermarket only has a two layer penetration, this is&nbsp;a government requirement for consumer use but you&rsquo;re basically wasting your money. To get a deeper penetration of four to five layers, you need a professional product.<br />\r\nThis addresses the aging process much&nbsp;more specifically for longer results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good organic day and night cream plus serums, which penetrate easily and are more specific to skin types, are essential for helping slow down the aging process and let&rsquo;s not forget&nbsp;a good eye cream. The skin around the eyes is much thinner than the rest of the face so it needs to be treated with different creams. In my opinion, professional skincare is a must to fend off wrinkles, pigmentation and sagging skin tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the best brand that&rsquo;s available in Dubai is Solgar. Supplements specifically for anti-aging are Vitamin C Ester, Omega 3, Vitamin E with Selenium, Zinc, B Complex and Sun Chlorella. They&rsquo;ll all help to balance the hormonal system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>DETOXING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing regular detoxes for many years and I think they&rsquo;re a must for keeping your system in tip-top health. I just did a five day juice fast with a company called Essentially &ndash; the juices are delivered to you each day and you drink a total of six juices a day &ndash; one every two hours. Easy! The owner of Essentially has been my client for many years and I know she puts her heart and soul into this business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For detox expertise in the UAE, go to www.essentially.ae, www.artofdetox.com or www.healthybliss.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREATMENTS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional treatments are the icing on the cake of anti-aging. My favourite natural treatment is Intraceuticals Oxygen which&nbsp;super hydrates the skin, leaving it lifted and shining. Not all oxygen facials are created equal however. The Intraceuticals oxygen facial is in a league of its own and uses serums and products that keep the skin looking amazing for weeks after the treatment. I seriously love this facial! Of course I would, it&rsquo;s one that I offer my clients. Go to www.katrinavalente.com for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a strong tightening treatment, I recommend the Radio Frequency facial, after five weekly treatments you&rsquo;ll see some great results that last for about three months after the treatments. A good alternative for those not wanting to have laser treatment. Go to www.medspa.ae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MEDITATION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if its only five minutes a day. When&nbsp;we live in awareness, it helps us take responsibility for our lives. Listening to&nbsp;the quiet voice within brings peace and acceptance of the here and now; taking each moment for what it is. Living in acceptance gives us freedom to realise our dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANTI-AGING ENEMIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Here are the culprits who will, without any shadow of doubt, speed up your aging process&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alcohol, sun and smoking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard it all before so just to further ingrain it on your brain. Alcohol, sun and smoking are the three stooges that will cause the most damage for your skin and liver &ndash; all of which makes you older, faster. Alcohol causes significant dehydration so if you must have a tipple, at least alternate it with water. As for smoking, I&rsquo;ve never understood the attraction of swallowing mouthfuls of toxin-filled smoke. It makes your skin grey and wrinkled, it clogs your pores, makes your hair and clothes smell, gives you bad breath&hellip; and lets not forget things like lung cancer, emphysema and other respiratory diseases plus the environmental impact of all those butts ending up in our waterways and oceans. Obviously, cigarettes are hard to kick otherwise no-one would smoke but make the effort to ditch these poisonous sticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sun is the biggest factor in premature aging. Too much of it causes skin cancer, moles, dehydration, burns, and aging. My 80-year-old Scottish mother has never laid in the sun&nbsp;and as a result has the most baby soft skin. Pure white with not a mark on it. Although, everything in moderation, we do need Vitamin D from the sun &ndash; something that most of us here in Dubai are deficient in. Spend 20 minutes per day outside to get your Vitamin D quota.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Junk food</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad food ages you, be it fried food, processed food, packet or powdered food, anything full of sugar, preservatives, artificial hormones, colourings and chemicals. You know this. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you. These foods clog you up and put pressure on your digestive system as well as fill your body with the articifical hormones that end up in our beef, chicken and fish. Go organic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lack of sleep</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late nights and less than seven hours sleep a night is another way to flick your &lsquo;get old faster&rsquo; switch. The hours before midnight are the most essential for energy and vitality so get to bed at 10pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Caffeine</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caffeine in soft drinks or coffee takes 24 hours to get through the liver. It&rsquo;s addictive and also very dehydrating. Coffee is a big part of Arab culture and genetically the Arab body can tolerate coffee better than a Caucasian person. Again though, a little of what you fancy does you good. If you enjoy coffee, drink it in moderation and make sure it&rsquo;s as high quality and organic as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>KATRINA VALENTE is a holistic&nbsp;beautician specialising in anti-aging.&nbsp;Call her on 050 565 7679 or email her at Katrina@katrinavalente.com and mention Awakenings magazine for a 20 per cent discount for new customers on any treatment.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>www.katrinavalente.com&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n', 'anti-aging-2-406x450.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:23:26'),

Or had someone&rsquo;s enthusiasm rub off on you? You&rsquo;re being affected by their energy field and picking up their vibration. In a similar way, crystals emit an energy vibration that can bring many benefits when utilised properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crystals don&rsquo;t heal your diseases or fix your issues but they assist in amplifying your own energy and accelerating your internal healing process. I think of themas a gang of close friends. Just like our friends, some crystals invigorate and some cheer you up while others soothe you. Also there might be some that you don&rsquo;t connect with at times. Let intuition be your guide in picking the right crystals for you. Always touch them and sense them before you buy. Still, the choice can be overwhelming and it can all get very complicated because there are so many different crystals, all with differing properties, so in this article we&rsquo;re sticking to the basic to get you started.Here are some of the most commonly used crystals and what they can help you with&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ROSE QUARTZ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most popular crystals, Rose Quartz is the soft, pretty love guru. Associated with the heart chakra, this pink coloured quartz is known for its unconditional love. She will either help you in attracting the right mate or help you heal from the wrong one. Rose quartz also helps with forgiveness, gentleness, compassion and most importantly self-love. She is the one who pushes us forward when we feel low about ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;CITRINE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citrine would be the power dressing, moneymaking, successful friend who is all about pushing us into action.Associated with the solar plexus, this yellow coloured quartz is all about making things happen in the physical plane. Citrine helps enhance your personal power,mental focus and creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CARNELIAN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have that one friend who is so at ease with themselves that they glow with the power. That&rsquo;s Carnelian for you.This crystal helps you in owning your power yet grounds and stabilises you.It has a warm, joyous and gratuitous energy to it. Linked to the sacral and root chakra, this orange helps in owning our sexuality too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TURQUOISE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vibrant and charming yet also soothing,Turquoise is the stone you pick when you have to make yourself heard. Turquoise assists in resolving communication issues and keeps reminding us to speak our truth without fear. Turquoise is also beneficial in protecting against any outside influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CLEAR QUARTZ</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muddled and confused? Don&rsquo;t know where to turn for guidance?Clear Quartz is your best friend. Helps in finding focus and clarity while kick starting your intuitive abilities. It also aids in your spiritual journey by working on clearing your Third Eye and Crown Chakra. Clear Quartz also assists in amplifying the energies of other crystals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AMETHYST</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The friend who makes you forget your problems, Amethyst is the epitome of peace and calm and is known for relieving stress instantaneously. It also shares qualities with Clear Quartz by assisting in your spiritual journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OBSIDIAN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This your no nonsense buddy who will bring you back to earth when you are flying too high and at the same time pushes you forward when you aren&rsquo;t moving. This one friend knows how to keep it real by helping you face what you are denying and unwilling to look at. Also protects you from negative energies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to use c</strong><strong>rystals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First things first, when you buy yourself anew crystal make sure that you cleanse it in any of the ways listed below. That way you remove any remnant energies from the people who have handled it previously and restore it to its full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Wash them under running water</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Keep them in a bowl of salt and water. Some crystals disintegrate or lose colour in water so be wary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Smudge with incense or sage</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Clear using singing bowls</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Bury them under soil or in your potted plant</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Visualise your crystal under white light with the intention of clearing it.It also helps to charge your crystals every once in a while by leaving&nbsp;them under sunlight or moonlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to state the intention for which you want to use it for. Pick the right crystal for the job so if you want love, rose quartz, if you want confidence to speak up, go turquoise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to incorporate crystals in everyday life is to get small tumbled stones and carry them with you in your purse or your pocket. The crystal needs to be in physical contact with you so it attunes itself to your energy. I like wearing them as jewellery so I got myself a pendant cage that way I can keep changing the crystals as permy mood and requirements.You can buy a pendant cage at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sparklefairy.com/\">www.sparklefairy.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people use crystals in meditation to get specific guidance or they place specific crystals on parts of the body to accelerate healing but that&rsquo;s getting beyond the basics so we&rsquo;ll leave that for a future article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHERE TO BUY CRYSTALS IN THE UAE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sparklefairy: &nbsp;</strong>Online storewww.sparklefairy.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Laughing Buddha:&nbsp;</strong>Festival city, IbnBattuta and Souq Al Bahar</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Art &amp; Picture Framing:&nbsp;</strong>Ground floor, Lamcy&nbsp;Plaza</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elements Fengshui:&nbsp;</strong>Al Khaleej Centre,Deira City Centre and level one Mall of the Emirates</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRYSTALS AND PHYSICAL HEALING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/crystals-circle-e1387026359860.jpg\"><img alt=\"crystals circle\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/crystals-circle-e1387026359860.jpg\" style=\"height:192px; width:200px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick guide on which crystals help with which physical symptoms of disease or discomfort&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aventurine (healing stone):&nbsp;</strong>Releasing toxins, near-sightedness, skin issues<br />\r\n<strong>Amethyst:&nbsp;</strong>Headaches, insomnia, stress, overcoming addictions<br />\r\n<strong>Citrine:&nbsp;</strong>Depression, digestive issues, stomach, kidney and liver problems<br />\r\n<strong>Hematite:&nbsp;</strong>Aids blood circulation, increases blood supply<br />\r\n<strong>Moonstone:&nbsp;</strong>Aids fertility, female reproductive issues, balances hormones</p>\r\n', 'amethyst.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:41:04'),
(74, 'Reiki for animals', 'body', 'eco & lifestyle', 'spirituality', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Is your pet absorbing your issues? From falcons to puppies, fish, reptiles, monkeys, horses, cats and wild animals &ndash; a little energy healing goes a long way. &nbsp;Words by Tamara Pitelen.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who believe in energy healing, physical and mental illness are the manifestations&nbsp;of unresolved emotional issues. For example, energy healers believe that diseases like cancer can be the result of an inability to receive love due to perhaps a subconscious belief of not being worthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing these emotional root causes of disease is the purpose of healing modalities such as Theta healing, Hypnotherapy, Reiki, Pranic healing, Spiritual Response Therapy and other energetic based therapies.<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s not just humans who manifest illness as a result of unresolved emotional issues though, Dubai-based Reiki healer Sabine Poncelet believes many of the problems animals have are often the result of their own feelings&nbsp;of abandonment, jealousy, neglect, or lack of love. In addition she says, our pets are also a sponge for our negative emotions and feelings.&ldquo;Reiki is energy, ultimately. It&rsquo;s a life force energy and when your energy is not in balance you can get sick,&rdquo; Poncelet says.&ldquo;Your chakras are energy centres. The best example is your solar plexus chakra, which is linked mainly to all your digestive organs. When you have a stomach ulcer, even a traditional doctor will tell you, &lsquo;reduce your stress&rsquo;.&ldquo;When your energy centres are not balanced, you develop problems. It&rsquo;s the same with animals but more so&nbsp;because people transfer their energies to their pets. When you touch or stroke an animal, you may not realise it but you are transferring your energy and emotions. Animals are like a sponge in that way, so are young children.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BORN INTUITIVE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally from from Belgium, Poncelet has been in Dubai since 2011. For more than 15 years she was a financial controller before becoming a full-time Reiki and energy healer for humans and animals. She knew&nbsp;at the age of seven that she had a&nbsp;natural talent for healing and could communicate with animals but it wasn&rsquo;t until she healed her own daughter with Reiki that she devoted herself fully to energy healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was very intuitive. When I put my hands on people with pain or injuries, they disappeared. I could communicate with animals too; I could feel what they were thinking. I also knew things in advance but my mother said to me, &lsquo;oh it&rsquo;s just your imagination, forget about this&hellip;&rsquo; so of course I believed her and for a long time I didn&rsquo;t use my abilities like I use them now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she got older though, Poncelet started researching healing modalities like Reiki and Magnetism. She studied Reiki initially in Europe as she found it was the modality that offered the best explanation for her natural gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HANDS ON HEALING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poncelet&rsquo;s first major success was&nbsp;when her own daughter was born with gastric reflux. She was aged 24 and her newborn baby could not hold milk down because the valve at the bottom of her esophagus would not close. So, she would vomit everything back up, which caused major internal inflammation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She was just one month old when my doctor told me she would have to be on medication for six years but that this would not heal her, the medication would only reduce the symptoms,&rdquo; Poncelet said. &ldquo;I would have tried anything so I put my hands on her in the place she had the pain.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next two years, Poncelet gave her daughter the doctor&rsquo;s medication but she also gave her regular Reiki healing sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After two years I stopped the medication because she was fully healed &ndash; something the doctor said would never happen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, Poncelet studied more energy healing modalities and worked on family and friends with wonderful results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For 20 years, I was working more on people than animals and initially I only worked on my own animals but later on, when I was about 36, I started working on the animals of my friends in Belgium. Mostly on dogs, cats and horses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOG DEMENTIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animals are very sensitive to energy, Poncelet says, and often respond very well to Reiki and energy healing. She says the issues pets can be caused</p>\r\n\r\n<p>by the owner &ndash; not all the time but<br />\r\nit happens. As in the case with a Pekinese dog she worked on recently who suffered from panic attacks, anxiety, sleeplessness and dementia.<br />\r\nIn his crazed episodes, he would run straight into walls and his owners were at a loss as to how to help him, they were considering euthanasia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Geordie is 13 years old and after six Reiki sessions he is now fine but when the owner called me, this dog was in a terrible state, he was crazy. It was my first case of dementia and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do but when I touched him to do the Reiki, I discovered that he was very linked to this woman, his owner. Some dogs are more independent, less sensitive but this dog was soul-linked to her. The dog was like her baby and of course the dog can feel this so he was emotionally involved in the woman&rsquo;s troubles. She had a lot&nbsp;of problems in her life so she was very stressed and depressed. Unfortunately, her dog took on her troubles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At first, I didn&rsquo;t expect a great result because I didn&rsquo;t know the origin of the dementia, but when I discovered the origin was in the dog/owner relationship and the dog was having panic attacks because of the owner&rsquo;s troubles, I thought &lsquo;ok, now I&rsquo;ve got the root&rsquo;. The illness is the consequence of the root trouble. You have to get the root and sometimes it&rsquo;s completely different to the illness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the owner understood this, she began making changes in her life, Poncelet says. &ldquo;Since the Reiki, Geordie</p>\r\n\r\n<p>has been much better, the owner sent me a message last week saying, &lsquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s wonderful, I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you. We&rsquo;re doing so much better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HORSE PLAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like humans, animals suffer from emotional stress and physical illness but some animals are more sensitive than others, Poncelet says. Dolphins are the most sensitive animals on Earth followed by horses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we use horses to work with autistic children because they&nbsp;are able to understand certain things, when you speak with a horse &ndash; not like speaking with a human &ndash; you have the feeling that he understands you. I can&rsquo;t explain it, it&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She tells the story of another recent canine client, a chihuahua that was dying from a cancerous tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This chihuahua was at the end of her life when the woman called me, there was not much I could do other than relieve the animal&rsquo;s suffering in its final days. That first session was 90 minutes long, normally a session is about 30 minutes to an hour but this little dog was sucking in the energy she needed. I asked the dog what happened and how she was feeling, she communicated with me she was feeling depressed, and sad. She told me that since her owner&rsquo;s baby was born, she had felt rejected. The dog told me, &lsquo;she didn&rsquo;t look at me anymore; I was abandoned like I was nothing&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After the session, I asked the owner when the cancer had developed and she said, &lsquo;after my baby was born, maybe nine months to a year later&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe cancer is the result a lack of love, especially for humans. It can manifest because you cannot express your love or you don&rsquo;t know how to receive love, it&rsquo;s linked. For animals it is the same, in this case especially.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chihuahua died four days later but the owner&rsquo;s feedback was that, after the Reiki session, the dog was much more peaceful and the relationship between the dog and the woman was better so the little dog passed away&nbsp;in peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THOUGHTS ARE ENERGY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Poncelet would like people to understand is that their emotions can affect their pets and that the pet&rsquo;s own feelings contribute to physical and mental ailments, this could be sadness, rejection, abandonment, neglect, etc&nbsp;and could be caused by anything from a new animal or baby being brought into the house to old trauma from abuse or neglect from their early life. Even if an animal is now in a loving home, it may have psychological issues stemming from early ill treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe your illnesses start with your thoughts because your body reacts to your thoughts. It is all just energy that flows through the meridians and chakras of your body and into your organs. It&rsquo;s the same thing for animals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Poncelet, seeing her animal clients become happier, healthier little creatures after a few sessions of energy healing gives her great joy and satisfaction.&nbsp;Poncelet hopes that one day it will be commonplace to combine alternative and complementary therapy with traditional veterinarian practice as well as with allopathic medicine for humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UAE, this is not usual&nbsp;yet but in the US, Reiki is now commonplace in hospitals with many patients opting for a Reiki session before surgery. In Japan, Theta healing is being used in hospitals&nbsp;and in Germany and Switzerland,&nbsp;a Reiki consultation and treatment&nbsp;is refunded under your health insurance policy, as long as the Reiki practitioner is certified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We owe so much to the animals in our lives,&rdquo; Sabine says. &ldquo;Animals teach us a lot of things including, how to be committed, how to&nbsp;love unconditionally, and how to receive love because they love you unconditionally, all animals without any exception.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PET OWNERS&rsquo; FEEDBACK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We spoke to some of the people who&rsquo;ve taken their troubled pets to Sabine Poncelet for Reiki healing, here&rsquo;s what they said:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cat: Hippie, age 4<br />\r\nHuman: Lucie Fonseca, Dubai<br />\r\nIssue: Hippie wouldn&rsquo;t accept a new cat into the house.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Hippie was rescued from the streets of Abu Dhabi when she was about a year old. When she came to us, she was very scared and jumpy. She was also afraid of other cats. Whenever there was another cat around, she would become obsessed by it, stalk and growl all the time, stop eating, stop sleeping, stop purring. She would be very stressed. In April this year, we decided to adopt a new cat, Pepper. We asked Sabine to do a Reiki treatment on Hippie to help her deal with the stress of the other cat in the house. We did one session before the two cats were introduced and one after. The results were brilliant. After the treatments, Hippie accepted Pepper really fast. One week after the second Reiki treatment, we were able to leave the two cats together without supervision and there were no fights. They did not become best friends but they co-exist peacefully. I think Sabine&rsquo;s intervention helped Hippie feel relaxed and secure so she didn&rsquo;t feel the need to show aggression and the introduction was a success.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horse: Prince, age four and a half<br />\r\nHuman: Vicky Remy, Belgium<br />\r\nIssue: Prince was losing weight and refusing to eat<br />\r\nNot long after we bought Prince in 2008, he virtually stopped eating despite no physical problem and the vet didn&rsquo;t know why.<br />\r\nHe lost a lot of weight, we were very&nbsp;worried. After the first Reiki session,&nbsp;we could see he was feeling better,&nbsp;he started to smell his food and nibble&nbsp;small portions. Sabine said the horse&nbsp;was feeling very sad because he had lost&nbsp;a much loved family member. After the two&nbsp;sessions he was eating normally again&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ve never had this problem&nbsp;with him since. Sometime&nbsp;later, we found out from&nbsp;the previous owners&nbsp;that Prince had lost his&nbsp;mate not long before&nbsp;we got him. Sabine&nbsp;completely surpassed<br />\r\nour expectations; we&nbsp;are very grateful.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRIED AND TESTED BY JAKE THE AWAKENINGS CAT</strong><br />\r\n<em>Can Reiki really help pets be happier and healthier? Awakenings wanted to find out so we took animal Reiki healer Sabine Poncelet home to give our cat, Jake, a health check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Sabine to come over to our house and give our two-year-old cat Jake a check up, we honestly thought there was nothing wrong with him. Apart from a little limping from a hip operation he&rsquo;d had about 12 months earlier, he seemed fine. How wrong we were!<br />\r\nSabine came over and after a 10 minute body scan of Jake and a chat with him via his higher self, we were surprised to be told that he was feeling intense pain around his teeth and jaw area and that the parasites in his small intestine were out of control which was giving him an upset stomach. We had to admit he was long overdue a de-worming treatment.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Take him to vet to check,&rdquo; Sabine said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is causing the pain around his teeth and jaws but he tells me it is intense and he cannot cope with it, he has asked for help. &ldquo;As for the hip, he says this doesn&rsquo;t really bother him, only sometimes, he can cope with<br />\r\nit. A joint supplement would help though.&rdquo;<br />\r\nSo Sabine gave Jake some Reiki to suppress the pain for a while and we took Jake to the vet a couple of days later. Sure enough, the vet tells us that Jake has a severe ear infection caused by ear mites and that it would be causing him a lot of pain. We then remembered he had been scratching his ears a lot lately, we&rsquo;d even mentioned it a couple of weeks earlier.<br />\r\nBy the next day, it was obvious even to us that Jake was in a huge amount of pain and discomfort but at least we&rsquo;d started him on medication for the ear infection. It was heart-breaking to see him in so much pain so we got Sabine back in to do a full Reiki session on him. He communicated with her that the pain was now consuming his whole head.<br />\r\nShe worked on him for about 30 minutes and he seemed slightly better immediately. Within 24 hours, he was noticeably better. We&rsquo;re extremely grateful to Sabine for her help with Jake. It was also interesting to hear some of the other things he had to say as well, for example, apparently<br />\r\nhe gets bored sometimes and he doesn&rsquo;t feel very confident about facing up to other cats in the neighbourhood. So, we&rsquo;re going to get another cat to be his companion, a very young female, Sabine advises, and we&rsquo;ll get him a Reiki session to work on his confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>ï¿¼SABINE PONCELET is the founder of Animal Reiki Dubai, as well as dogs and cats, she works with falcons, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and wild animals.

(75, 'Spa review Altearah Wellbeing Facial', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><strong>Aspen Aman tries and tests the Altearah Wellbeing Facial at SpaDunya Club in Shams, JBR, Dubai.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was asked to review the Altearah Wellbeing Facial, I was intrigued. A facial that uses colour therapy &ndash; wonderful! I am fascinated by how the vibrations of different colours impact mood, health and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all of SpaDunya&rsquo;s treatments,&nbsp;this facial started out with the colour therapy consultation. Colour therapist Karima Nanji asked me to select four colours from the set of 14 therapeutic hues in the Altearah set.&nbsp;She explained that the first colour reflects the colour vibration that one needs today; the second represents a significant block or deficit that must be addressed; the third colour augments the second colour; and the fourth colour signifies the vibration or energy that one is moving toward. The colours I chose&nbsp;&ndash; gold, emerald, indigo and orange &ndash; turned out to be major components in the Wellbeing facial &ndash; so I was very happy to be getting the colour therapy in addition to the facial!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yupin, the facial therapist, settled me on a lovely treatment bed complete with a back warmer. I especially appreciated this extra touch, as I tend to get very cold in massage or other beauty treatment rooms. Yupin started by spraying each of the four colours individually on to my palms and asking me to inhale each colour three times. This introduces both the fragrance and energy of the unique essential oil blend as well as the colour&rsquo;s specific vibration directly into the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambient music and soft lighting, combined with Yupin&rsquo;s skillful facial massage, quickly sent me into a blissful, semi-sleeping state. Yupin cleansed, massaged and moisturised my face and neck. The fragrant lotions used in the Wellbeing Facial are infused with serums of the four colours: silver, emerald, indigo and orange. Silver&nbsp;is for repair/reconstruction; emerald for oxygen/breath; indigo for relaxation, clarity and sleep, and orange for creativity and sensuality. The serums used in the facial are five times stronger than the sprays used at the beginning of the session, so the vibration of each colour is a key part of the facial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another unique aspect of my facialwas the therapist&rsquo;s use of Vietnamese facial reflexology, which associates various parts of the face to organ systems within the body. Yupin applied gentle and then slightly stronger pressure to specific reflexology points on my face with special instruments known as Dien Chan tools. I felt soft but powerful surges of energy within various parts of my body as Yupin did the reflexology with the Dien Chan tools. I felt that the reflexology was stimulating various energy channels as Yupin accessed different pressure points on my face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Yupin finished the initial massage and cleansing parts of the treatment,&nbsp;she applied a light but very moisturising mask to my face and neck. While the moisturising mask absorbed into my skin, Yupin treated me to a Thai-style massage of my head, neck, arms and legs that relaxed me even further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of the aroma and colour therapies of the essential oils, the Dien Chan facial reflexology and the natural cleansers and moisturisers left my skin glowing and soft. I left SpaDunya feeling&nbsp;&ndash; and looking &ndash; radiant and refreshed. I&rsquo;ll definitely be back for more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Altearah Wellbeing Facial is a 60 or 90 minute treatment, AED 395 or AED 584 (prices valid as of July 2013).

(76, '30 Day Pilates Challenge', 'body', 'body', '', 'weight-loss', 'fitness', '<p><em><strong>What happens to your body if you do Pilates for 30 days? We got a male and female guinea pig to find out. She&rsquo;s fat, hes fit&hellip; what can Pilates do for them?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph H. Pilates, the founder of the eponymous exercise method, said of Pilates, &ldquo;After 30 sessions you will have a completely new body.&rdquo; But is that true? With the kind help of the team at Real Pilates,&nbsp;<em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;put Mr Pilates&rsquo; claim to the test using two guinea pigs who couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Mika is an unfit and slightly overweight&nbsp;female and Erin is a super fit male without an ounce of extra body fat. What will 30 days of Pilates do for them? Read on to find out&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, meet the guinea pigs.<br />\r\n<strong>The male: Erin Ewing</strong><br />\r\nAn Advertising Director for a media company, Erin is in his early 30s and has been a long-term regular gym goer who&rsquo;s been doing Pilates for a few months. Fitness-wise he is in great shape but&nbsp;he would like to abolish the continual&nbsp;back pain from his years of dancing and gymnastics as a teenager. He&rsquo;d also like to sleep better and improve his posture &ndash; like many people, hunching over a computer all day is taking its toll. Finally, he wants to be better at the more advanced Pilates exercises that he currently struggles with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The female: Mika Brison</strong><br />\r\nIn her mid 40s, Mika is a financial magazine editor who has worked in print media for 20 years &ndash; which means she has spent 8 to 10 hours a day sat at a computer for two decades. She is carrying too much body&nbsp;fat and her lower abdominals are weak &ndash; despite ongoing efforts to strengthen them. She would like to have toned, strong arms. The last time she did a Pilates class was about 10 years ago and she wasn&rsquo;t a fan, &ldquo;They made me hold painful positions for far too long and lift medicine balls.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MIKA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one: So far so good. My&nbsp;first class was great. To kick off the challenge, I did a Total Body Toning class. It involves using various bits of&nbsp;kit like weight balls, toning balls, flex bands, rubber bands and this circular contraption that goes between, say, your knees or thighs and you have to squeeze it. The time flew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day two: We got some good news and bad news after class tonight. Erin and I bumped into Paul, a Real Pilates instructor who&rsquo;s been teaching Pilates for 10 years. He told us that Pilates is not about sweating (that&rsquo;s the good news) and that it is not a<br />\r\nfat burner (bad news). The &lsquo;no sweat&rsquo; news was a surprise because I&rsquo;d just watched Erin sweat so much in the Core Physique class that there was a little puddle on his mat at the end. Pure Pilates, said Paul, is about finesse &ndash; doing the moves with precision and care in order to fire up the many smaller muscles we don&rsquo;t normally use because&nbsp;our big muscles take over. It&rsquo;s by recruiting these smaller muscles that we transform&nbsp;our posture, sculpt our physiques and fix a variety of injuries, such as spine and back pain. He&rsquo;s seen people miraculously change their bodies with time and hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day four: Pilates can make you taller. That&rsquo;s why Hollywood celebs do it. Pilates is all about the spine. Keeping it flexible and stretching out the vertebrae. Real Pilates instructor Manny told us this during a Group Discovery class, that&rsquo;s the learner class you have to do before you&rsquo;re allowed to do the Reformer classes that involve the machines with lots of bits that move about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day six: I have push-up envy. And plank envy. In the last two days, I&rsquo;ve done classes involving lots of push-up and planks &ndash; Weight-loss Pilates and Core Physique. The instructors, Elisha and Dora, make them look effortless. This is because they have core strength of steel and abdominals of iron. They effortlessly do full push-ups &ndash; not the ones on your knees &ndash; the full body push-ups. Then they make them harder by raising one leg or rolling a ball between their hands. Me, my whole body shakes with the effort, my arms give way beneath me and I end up face first on the mat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 10: Happy days. My trousers feel looser. No change on the scales but the waistband is baggier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 11: In a Total Body Toning class with Paul, he tells me that I&rsquo;ve been doing crunches and sit ups incorrectly my whole life, which means I haven&rsquo;t been recruiting the deep abdominal muscles. Instead, I&rsquo;ve been using my neck to lift my torso up, which is why I quickly get severe neck pain and have to support my head with my hands. That&rsquo;s why, despite having done bazillions of crunches and sit-ups over the years, my core never gets stronger. Darn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 16: More depressing revelations from Paul. He tells me that 20 years&nbsp;of sitting at a computer and having a &ldquo;sedentary lifestyle&rdquo; (Sedentary? How very dare he!) has caused me to have a flexed posture &ndash; this means I&rsquo;m collapsing in the front, hunching in other words. &ldquo;This is causing your head to come forwards,&rdquo; Paul said, &ldquo;which has a negative impact on your spine because of its weight placement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I spend another 20 years sitting like this, he says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at degenerative discs; herniation of the discs, which<br />\r\nmeans the disc comes out of its casing and ruptures. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at pain and nerve damage; and constant stress in your upper trapezius and neck muscles. People develop nagging back pain because of a lack of stability throughout the body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had some reassuring words&nbsp;if I changed my ways though: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rebalance the muscles around the structure. Muscles have memory, if you train them a certain way, they will restore the natural balance of the body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 20: Met a friend for coffee and when we hugged &lsquo;hello&rsquo; she grabbed my arms and gasped, &lsquo;When did you get such toned arms?&rsquo; Yessss!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 28 &ndash; My boyfriend said to me today: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking good Honey. All that Pilates is doing something isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 30: I absolutely love Pilates. I may be addicted to it. I don&rsquo;t want this challenge to end, I feel amazing for it.<br />\r\nI can see the difference; my clothes are looser and my arms have shape. It&rsquo;s not over though. My lower abs are still too weak to do roll-ups properly and I want to be able to do more full push-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BIRTH OF PILATES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pilates is a low-impact exercise regime started by Joseph Pilates. During WWI he worked as a nurse in the UK and developed exercises to rehabilitate injured soldiers. Having no gym equipment, he used whatever was available; bed springs and beer keg rings became resistance exercise equipment and were the prototypes of the equipment used today, like the reformer and the magic circle. General health, Joseph said, centres around body posture, mechanics, correct breathing, spinal flexibility and appropriate physical exercise. He studied eastern and western forms of exercise including yoga, Zen, Greek and Roman wrestling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ERIN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one: Excited to be starting this challenge. I feel confident because I&rsquo;ve been doing Pilates for a while. I want to get the most out of this so my focus is on being precise and accurate with the moves and being conscious of how my body works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day three: Class was awesome last night and I felt amazing leaving. It was tough but good fun and I can feel that my balance is getting better. My abs are pulled in and tight though I am not getting the upper back stability that I need and my lower obliques feel mushy. Though, all in all, a lot better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day six: I&rsquo;m struggling with the roll- ups because my lower abs are weak but I&rsquo;m sleeping better, which is a relief. I&rsquo;ve been off and on insomniac for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 10: Really sore today after doing two Core Physique classes in a row. Elisha, the teacher, is great but it&rsquo;s a killer work out. I&rsquo;ve noticed I&rsquo;m getting less lower back pain as well&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not gone. I&rsquo;m making the effort to think about my posture all day and I took a private lesson with Paul to get some help with specific issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 15: My abs are much more pronounced so happy about that but the back pain is still bothering me so I went to back to my osteopath. Turns out that I have a tilted pelvis but even the osteopath noticed that my body looks more toned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 20: My balance in the mat classes is improving and I can really see my stomach muscles now. My obliques are more defined than they&rsquo;ve ever been &ndash; despite years and years spent doing crunches and sit-ups in the gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 25: I&rsquo;m focusing on refining the really small movements this week so I can work on stabilizing. I&rsquo;ve already noticed that my posture is better; I&rsquo;m stacking my spine more easily. My shoulder blades still aren&rsquo;t doing what I want them to though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 30: Done! The challenge is complete. I&rsquo;m not stopping Pilates though. I&rsquo;ll keep going because I really want to master the advanced moves &ndash; anyone who thinks Pilates is easy should try a Power Pilates or a Cardio Reformer class then shut the heck up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In just a month of classes, I saw significant improvements in some areas. For example, my ability to do some of more advanced moves that I just couldn&rsquo;t do on day one. Some of my more stubborn issues remain though, like the back pain. It&rsquo;s<br />\r\ngoing to take more than a month to unravel some of the deeper structural issues but<br />\r\nthe difference is that I am now conscious of what I&rsquo;m doing incorrectly. I&rsquo;m 100 per cent committed to continuing. I even went out and bought toning balls, a medicine ball, Stott Pilates video and elastic bands so I can do the exercises at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I learnt through this is that effective exercise isn&rsquo;t always about pumping weights or getting out of breath on a treadmill. Some of the most difficult and transforming exercises involved tiny moves of a centimetre. The important thing is to do that tiny, precise move in the correct way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The various classes are very different though and you should pick your type of class based on what you want to achieve. For example, if you want to drop body fat, get a few Core Physique and Power Pilates classes into your week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT CAN&nbsp;PILATES DO&nbsp;FOR YOU?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Real Pilates trainer Paul Thornley reveals what Pilates is all about and what it can do for you&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Pilates is about improved lifestyle and overall health through a clearer awareness of how your body should structurally work. Longer term, that prevents pain. We&rsquo;re not focused on intensity or repetition; we&rsquo;re focused on quality of movement. There&rsquo;s<br />\r\nno point in exercising if you&rsquo;re doing it incorrectly just to get through a set of repetitions because the body will always find the easiest way to do the work, it will always try and cheat, usually by recruiting the big muscles. We promote a more balanced muscular activity so give these smaller muscles the opportunity to work by not allowing the dominant muscles to take over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Pilates promotes better spinal movement so gravity doesn&rsquo;t have such a negative impact on us as life generally does. These days everything we do is seated &ndash; we sitatadesk,weeatatatable,weflopon the couch to watch television so we don&rsquo;t recruit the muscles to help us sit upright anymore. If we use our muscular structure incorrectly and allow it to negatively<br />\r\neffect our skeletal system, our bones,&nbsp;then you&rsquo;re going to have pain so whether it&rsquo;s for rehabilitation after an injury or an Olympic athlete wanting to complement their strength and conditioning programme, Pilates is absolutely for everybody.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE RESULTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did 30 days of Pilates do for our guinea pigs? Drum roll please&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mika lost two kilograms in weight and lost 11 centimetres in measurements &ndash; including four centimetres off her waist along with an increase on her biceps of half a centimetre each. Her muscle mass went up very slightly and body fat went down 1.5 per cent.</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td><img alt=\"page4image17784\" src=\"file:///page4image17784\" style=\"height:15.404098;

So the feisty Scotswoman turned to juicing and got her life back. Words by Tamara Pitelen.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even when I was three years old, I thought I was fat,&rdquo; says Dubai&nbsp;expat Paula Hughes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a photo of me and my sister when&nbsp;I was three years old. I was in a blue bikini; she was in a red one. I clearly remember what I was thinking as that picture was being taken. I was thinking that I didn&rsquo;t want the photo taken because I looked fat in my bikini.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My sister was a year older but I grew faster so we looked like twins. Then I overtook her so I was always called &lsquo;the big one&rsquo;. I think you become that self-fulfilling prophecy, you become what people imprint on you.&rdquo; Growing up in a big Scottish family, Paula says she was always overfed. &ldquo;You go back for seconds and then you have Gran&rsquo;s homemade pudding at the end so you stuff&nbsp;your face, clear your plate so you can have pudding. It&rsquo;s all about food; my family is still all about food. It was all homemade cooking, cakes, biscuits and indulgences that people give you as a child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I would eat until I was literally sick. No one ever stepped in to stop me and I was the kind of child that &lsquo;if you give it to me, fine, I&rsquo;ll eat it till I&rsquo;m ill&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another trigger for a life as a comfort eater came in the lead up to her parents getting divorced. Paula says if her parents were fighting her mum would say, &lsquo;come on girls, get something from the sweetie tin and go to your rooms.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As a result I now associate things that upset me with sweet foods.&rdquo; A realisation Paula made recently with the help of a psychologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAT GIRL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even so, Paula says she always had a predisposition to gravitate towards food and excess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was into food from very young; I always ate more than I should have done. Even with things like a cup of tea, other people would have one sugar; I&rsquo;d have four or five teaspoons. I think it was a rebellious thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using food as a weapon soon turned into full-blown eating disorders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suffered from bulimia since I was 13 and even thought you have peaks and troughs with it, it&rsquo;s with you for the rest of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At 15, I starved myself in protest with my parents and did obsessive aerobics exercise. I lived on water for a week, it took a friend to say to me, &lsquo;your parents haven&rsquo;t&nbsp;even noticed, just eat for goodness.&rsquo; That was quite a momentous time in my childhood but it was connected to change; my parents had divorced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Bulimia is a control thing. The only thing you can control is what you eat but to eat a massive amount of food then to purge it is really disgusting when you think about it. It&rsquo;s easy to use food as a weapon but you only hurt yourself.&rdquo;<br />\r\nOne side effect of the bulimia was her teeth rotting away from the stomach acid. Now, her whole upper row of teeth is veneers. By age 23 Paula weighed 135kgs (21 stone) and her dress size was a UK 24-26.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next 15 years her weight yo- yoed, it peaked at 135 kgs again in her late 20s and for a third time in her early 30s, a year after she first came to Dubai in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paula says the pattern was that her weight would increase with life changes, for example, a change in relationship status or moving to a different country. Over the years she tried myriad ways to lose weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The worst was diet pills that had amphetamine. They were horrific. You got them on prescription in the UK. They said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t worry about dieting; these pills will increase your metabolism.&rsquo; After three days I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, function or relax, and I didn&rsquo;t lose any weight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paula also tried the cabbage soup diet, Slimfast, Weight Watchers, to name but a few. &ldquo;Another one was Obesity Helpline,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>which was powdered drinks of milkshakes and soups and a weigh in every week where you had to urinate on a piece of paper to prove you had ketones in your body and hadn&rsquo;t cheated. I went mental on that. I did lose weight but as soon as you stop, you gain it all back because you haven&rsquo;t dealt with the root problem; you&rsquo;re only addressing the outcome.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Paula changed focus from purely what was going into her mouth&nbsp;to what was going on in her head that she started making progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IT&rsquo;S ALL IN YOUR HEAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I started seeing a psychologist I realised my weight isn&rsquo;t just about what I put in my mouth. I spent about two years in that psychologist&rsquo;s clinic sobbing my heart out. Every little detail comes out, warts and all and if you don&rsquo;t let it, there&rsquo;s no point going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I also tried hypnotherapy and regression therapy, which has so many benefits, that&rsquo;s when I remembered the scene on the beach when I was three and getting my photo taken. I found that photo later and everything clicked into place. So, yes, there have been&nbsp;a few &lsquo;Aha&rsquo; moments of self-awareness, especially in the last two years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Paula hit her highest weight in Dubai in 2004, she was having a Redbull for breakfast then drinking diet Coke all day at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Over the years I&rsquo;ve had at least a litre and a half of diet Coke always on my desk. Then I&rsquo;d go out in the evening and drink vodka with diet Coke and eat enough high fat, high carb fast food for four people. It was layer upon layer of body abuse. I was a diet Coke addict. Since then I&rsquo;ve read about aspartame poisoning and toxicity and I look back and think, &lsquo;how am I still alive?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO OR DIE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, came the body blow from her doctor. &ldquo;She told me, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a walking time bomb, you could suffer stroke or heart attack at any time.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My blood pressure was 159 over 99. I wasn&rsquo;t exercising and my diet was high sodium and high fat. My doctor said, &lsquo;you need to go on medication.&rsquo; I was 38 and I knew that if I went on medication, I was charting a course for the rest of my life of more medication. I was sobbing in the doctor&rsquo;s office saying, &lsquo;no, I&rsquo;m not taking medication,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you have to, to save your life.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Medication is a slippery slope, you take one type and it has a side effect so you need another pill to tackle the side effects of the first pill and before you know it, you&rsquo;re taking handfuls a day. I don&rsquo;t want to be like that. Plus, the side effects are things like weight gain, headaches, nausea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d also just signed up to do a bootcamp course. The doctor said, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t do bootcamp with blood pressure like this.&rsquo; So she agreed to take the lowest dose of medication and with the incredible support of her friends, Paula started exercising and changing her eating patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A friend had given me a book on juicing so I made a half-hearted effort. I&rsquo;d drink a couple of juices a day but still eat take-away at night. I was also doing bootcamp though so I lost about 10 kilos in five months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then another challenge hit. During what should have been a routine vitamin&nbsp;D injection, the needle accidentally hit a nerve leaving Paula paralysed in her left leg and in severe pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was at home, completely depressed, couldn&rsquo;t move&hellip; I knew I had to heal this nerve and fix myself from the inside out. That was the start of really getting into juicing and natural foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I read a book on juicing by Jason Vale that changed everything for me; he talks about what the stuff you&rsquo;re eating and drinking does to your body and why you&rsquo;re addicted to it. He also talks about how the food industry does go out of its way to addict you and keep you weak. Then I booked one of his juicing bootcamp retreats in Turkey and that was where I was reborn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d get up at 6am, do a meditation or yoga session, then do 45 minutes of exercise like bums and tums or stretching, then have a shot of green super juice, then go on a two hour walk, then come back for the first juice, then there would be a lecture, more juicing, more exercise, some relaxation. I was doing five hours of exercise a day. I lost about five kilograms in a week. It was my first time proper detox and day three was horrendous, I spent the day crying and emotional but&nbsp;on day four I bounced out of bed before the alarm and I honestly felt reborn that day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DUBAI JUICE LADY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward a few months and Paula is a juicing convert and 50 kgs lighter than her highest weight. She&rsquo;s alson off the medication and her blood pressure is normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Juices make me feel wonderful, it&rsquo;s like they switch off the feelings associated with bulimia. When I go off juicing for a while, the danger sign is when I make a coffee&nbsp;with sugar at work, that&rsquo;s a sign I&rsquo;m entering a downward spiral. The combination of caffeine and sugar seem to trigger something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Juicing is so easy, it fits into my lifestyle and it&rsquo;s led to an interest in raw food so juicing has facilitated this wider knowledge of nutrition. Even if you just have one juice a day, it&rsquo;s an intense nutrient hit. My skin is better and my eyes are clearer. And I can fix all sorts of daily ailments, like water retention. Say you just get off a plane and you&rsquo;re a bit bloated, a juice with fennel, celery, ginger, and pineapple will sort that out; they&rsquo;re a magnet for the nasty stuff and they detox your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juicing, says Paula, has given her back her life as well as given her a life purpose. She&rsquo;s now studying to be a natural juice therapist and wants to make a career out of teaching others about the benefits of juicing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I went to Jason Vale&rsquo;s juicing academy last year and I&rsquo;m doing his natural juice therapist course, that&rsquo;s a self-study certification. It&rsquo;s the only course in the world certified by the Complementary Medical Association. It&rsquo;s heavy going, lots of biology and anatomy but it&rsquo;s the key to my dream of going full time with juicing as a career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Paula wants to lose another seven kilos but she thinks part of that process will involve getting back into a psychologist&rsquo;s&nbsp;or hypnotherapist&rsquo;s chair in order to finish dealing with the emotional root causes&nbsp;of her long-term weight issues but she believes that her first-hand experience of the complex causality of severe eating disorders and obesity issues means that she can understand better than anyone the battles of the chronically overweight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My plans are to help people empower themselves. I want to teach people they don&rsquo;t need pharmaceutical medications to live their life. Traditional doctors have a vital role in medical situations but there are so many conditions where a natural approach can be more successful and of course preventing those conditions in the first place is the best outcome.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIVE DAY JUICE FAST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is juicing really so great? The Awakenings team &ndash; Asma, Tam and Adrian &ndash; gave it the &lsquo;suck it and see test&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s what happened&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three of us &ndash; a male and two females &ndash; did Jason&rsquo;s Vale&rsquo;s annual Spring Clean five day juice fast, what happened? All three of us lost about 3.5kgs each; all of us were regularly hungry and all of us needed to eat the &ldquo;if you need it&rdquo; banana every day. (Yes Jason Vale, we needed it!)<br />\r\nOn the upside&hellip; obvious benefits besides weight-loss were much improved skin and we&rsquo;ve all maintained an element of juicing into our lives since then. The two of us who used to drink coffee and black tea have stayed off it since doing the fast &ndash; eight weeks at time of writing &ndash; and we feel great for that. As of four weeks later, we&rsquo;d all kept the weight off and Adrian (the male guinea pig) had even lost another two kilos. Six weeks later though, a couple of kilos had crept back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the downside&hellip; Asma suffered headaches through the fast, felt oddly cold and said her teeth<br />\r\nfelt coated. For Tam, a predisposition to candida (thrush) was triggered from all the high-sugar fruit<br />\r\nlike pineapple, apples and banana. We suspect they were also the cause of severe tooth problems for Adrian, which saw him spend five days off work and pay a AED 15,000 dental bill when one of his back teeth cracked right down the middle. Did the juice sugars exacerbate an already weakened tooth? We&rsquo;ll never know but we&rsquo;re highly suspicious and now focus on vegetable juicing as opposed to fruit juices. In summary&hellip; we all have a new love of juicing. It&rsquo;s easy and quick and an effective way to get a big dose of nutrients into your system quick. We all now include juicing in our daily lives but have tweaked the recipes to suite our individual body types and conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ANSWERING THE JUICE CRITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dubai&rsquo;s juice lady Paula Hughes addresses some of the most common criticisms of juicing&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. But you&rsquo;re losing all the fibre &ndash; you should eat the whole apple not only the juice</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fibre from fruit and vegetables that your body needs are the water soluble microfibres that can be absorbed by our bodies. Juice retains these microfibres and those are the ones that you want. Basically the juicer is doing a lot of the work of your digestive system. When you put fruit and vege in the chute, the machine extracts the nutrients and discards the rest. That&rsquo;s exactly what your digestive system does; extracts the nutrients, the fats, the proteins, etc that it needs to heal and run your body and expels what it doesn&rsquo;t need through the sphincter. Everything that goes into your stomach is broken down into a liquid. That&rsquo;s what takes your body so much time and energy. Juicing gives the body more time and energy and nutrients to go off and fix your skin, your nails, your eyes, your hair, or any health issues you may have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. What about protein? Do you worry about not getting enough?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, some of the biggest, most muscular animals on the planet are vegetarians. Plus, it&rsquo;s not about never eat non-juiced food again. Eat steak or salmon if you want just incorporate juicing as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Fast weight loss? Isn&rsquo;t this just a crash diet and the weight will come back?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you go back to the same diet that got you fat in the first place, then yes, you will gain weight back. If you change your diet and lifestyle permanently, weight-loss is sustainable but the&nbsp;final word is that, like anything, there is no cookie cutter answer for everyone. What works wonderfully for one person won&rsquo;t work for another, just give it a try and see for yourself.</p>\r\n', 'carrot-juice-1024x517.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:40:39'),
(78, 'DIY Holistic Detoxing', 'body', 'body', 'nutrition', '', '', '<p><em><strong>How and why to do a holistic detox. Nutrition coach Kaya Peters reveals the latest health trend in Hollywood circles &ndash; do try this at home!&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &lsquo;detox&rsquo; is often associated with deprivation, diet and generally forcing&nbsp;yourself to do something that makes you a bit miserable in the hope it&rsquo;ll do you some good. This is far from a durable solution to a healthier body and a better lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an alternative, Holistic Detoxing focuses on cleansing the physical body and inner organs, releasing mental stress and quieting the mind; a combination that will help regain a state of physical and mental equilibrium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While in other parts of the world,&nbsp;Holistic Detox is the Next Big Thing, no small thanks to celebrities like Heidi Klum and Elle Macpherson singing the praises of Holistic Detox programmes, the UAE is only now awakening to this trend in wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; actually mean? It&rsquo;s about focusing on all aspects of our being. Using mostly Eastern teachings as its basis, Holistic Medicine views a person as a whole, rather than just a body with a collection of symptoms. Examples of Holistic Medicine include Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yoga- related teachings and Ayurveda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where most detox programmes on the&nbsp;market work with fasting methods or drinking juices for several days in a row, Holistic Detoxing is a little different: A programme generally includes eating &lsquo;clean&rsquo; or unprocesed natural, whole foods, which are easy on the digestive system and have additional cleansing value. Examples are steamed vegetables, salads and certain types of fruit. In addition, as much of a special cleansing broth and water can&nbsp;be consumed as needed along with herbal supplements to assist the body in its detox process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CRAVINGS AND BINGES BEGONE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This &lsquo;diet&rsquo; is combined with mild forms of exercise, stretching and breathing techniques, which work on the emotions, as well as getting plenty of rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what are the benefits of doing a Holistic Detox? For a start, there&rsquo;s the obvious health benefits of a clean digestive system, rejuvenated liver, new life energy and feeling light and healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major advantage is that because this type of detox does not make you feel hungry or deprived, you&rsquo;re less likely to suffer cravings and over-indulge in processed or junk food before or after starting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>he well-known &lsquo;before diet binge&rsquo;, where you can still eat whatever you want because &lsquo;my diet will start tomorrow&rsquo; is taken away by using several days to prepare yourself for the detox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these first few days you cut out specific foods, like red meat, caffeine- based drinks, sugar and more. After the programme, you take the time to slowly go back to a long-term, healthy way of eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another benefit is the fact that a programme like this can kick-start a weight-loss effort and greatly accelerate weight-loss results. This is because people with a lot of toxicity in their bodies often have a harder time dropping a few kilos than someone who is clean on the inside &ndash; the body protects your organs from these toxins by storing them in fat cells. Toxic fat is stubborn and more difficult to lose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, this type of programme will help you kick your addictions to sugar and carbs; appreciate the taste of simple foods, and help you create new and healthy habits for life. Ok, are you ready to do it? Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIY HOME HOLISTIC DETOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exclusively for the readers of Awakenings Middle East magazine, Kaya reveals her three-day Home Detox secrets:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do your own mini detox at home, do the following over the course of three days.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Avoid all caffeinated drinks like coffee and green tea</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid all alcohol</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid all red meat</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid refined grains like white rice, white pasta, etc.</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid wheat products</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid dairy, except for live organic yoghurt</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid nuts, except for soaked almonds (soak them for six hours or overnight)</li>\r\n	<li>Focus on eating simple, one-ingredient foods</li>\r\n	<li>Use herbal teas to assist in the cleansing process (dandelion, mint, chamomile, redbush/ rooibos etc)</li>\r\n	<li>Drink three litres of water daily, and add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to each litre of water, this will help with liver detoxification.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>THREE-DAY HOLISTIC DETOX MENU:</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Wake-up: Two glasses of lukewarm water with the juice of half a squeezed lemon and a pinch of cayenne pepper<br />\r\n	Breakfast: Two green apples, 1 handful of blueberries or other fresh, non-sugary fruits in the morning (any type of berries and occasionally papaya due to its beneficial effects on the digestive system) Snack: 15 almonds pre-soaked in water (six hours or overnight)</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Lunch: Green salad, raw beetroot, beansprouts, and any other raw vegetable of choice (carrot, capsicum, lettuce, spinach, celery, etc), one cup of cooked quinoa, dressed in olive oil, apple cider vinegar and lemon juice.<br />\r\n	Snack: Raw carrot and celery sticks<br />\r\n	Dinner: Steamed broccoli (as much as you like), one cup of steamed pumpkin, one cup of steamed sweet potato.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Do this for three days and then slowly start adding other foods to your diet again, but stay away from anything processed, sugary and refined.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>For a simple daily detox, just make sure to drink plenty of water, eat green vegetables every day, and have some lemon water in the morning before breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Because this is a Holistic Detox, it&rsquo;s not just about the food. Over the three days, take time every day for light exercise and a form of meditation. For example, a Hatha yoga class, a Bikram yoga class, a Pilates Core class, or just go for a walk.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In addition to moving your body, spend at least&nbsp;10 minutes a day stilling your mind in meditation. This could be mantra chanting (search &lsquo;mantra meditation&rsquo; on YouTube &ndash; there are thousands).<br />\r\n	It could be staring silently at a candle flame; it could be simply watching your breath; it could&nbsp;be putting your iPod earphones in and listening&nbsp;to deep relaxation music like a Tibetan bowl session (again, loads on YouTube). Or you could do a guided meditation such as chakra cleansing either by yourself or at a local healing centre such as Illuminations in JLT. Experiment, search the internet and try something you&rsquo;ve not done before.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p><em><strong>Need some help or want to know more?

Holistic beautician Katrina Valente trials organic fake tanning.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer is coming and it&rsquo;s great to have a bit of colour to look fresh and healthy. Crazy at it seems, here in the&nbsp;UAE we live in the sun all year round but most of us are never tanned. Hence always being able to spot the &lsquo;holiday maker&rsquo;&hellip; the tanned tourists we see walking around the shopping malls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want that bronzed look without spending hours soaking up the harmful UV rays of the sun or sunbeds, fake tans are a great option. Fast and easy, as long as you go organic, it&rsquo;s all good!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, more organic options are now available if you want your fake tan without nasties like parabens and other potentially harmful chemicals. Remember, anything you put on your skin gets into your blood stream within minutes and sent swirling through your organs and brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First up, Xen-Tan. Completely organic, Xen-Tan smells delicious and goes on so easily. You can apply it yourself at home<br />\r\nor pay a professional to come and do it for you. I recently had a home visit from this fake tan favourite of the Hollywood set that includes celebs like Lady Gaga, Kate and Pippa Middleton, and Cameron Diaz in its fanbase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technician sprayed me twice over in just a few minutes. The spray dried almost instantly and left me looking&nbsp;brown. I went to bed, got up the next day, showered and voila! Instant gorgeous colour! It stayed on for around 10 days and faded naturally. No streaks, no patchy areas. I was very impressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other organic DIY &lsquo;tan and go&rsquo;&nbsp;worth trying is Irish brand Vita Liberata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celeb fans include Olly Murs, The Saturday&rsquo;s, One Direction, and Sinitta. Suitable for skin from the fairest to the darkest, Vita Liberata is organic and free of parabens, perfume, alcohol and toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Xen-Tan and Vita Liberata have an extensive range of retail products&nbsp;for home use that come in sprays,&nbsp;gels, mousses and creams for face and body. Prices range from AED 100 to AED 300, depending on the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VITA LIBERATA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can get a professionally applied Vita Liberata spray tan here in the UAE from the following outlets: Pastels, Nadia Beauty Centre, Sugar and Spice (Abu Dhabi), The Cure Beauty &amp; Wellness Lounge, Roots, The Beauty Spot (Abu Dhabi), Kalm Spa, Hair Lounge and Dial a Nail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, go to&nbsp;www.vitaliberata.ae</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XEN-TAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The home spray service will be resumed after Ramadan. Meanwhile, you can get a professional Xen-Tan spray at Bodysmart and Pastels salon. To DIY at home, the retail product can be bought from Sephora, Dubai Duty Free, Emirates Aircrew and Atrium shop.

Prepare your skin! A good exfoliation is what&rsquo;s needed. Do it the day before or just before application with either a body brush or a paste of sea salt and olive oil<br />\r\nor almond oil &ndash; that&rsquo;s the cheap way. Alternatively, use your favourite organic body scrub. For more friction &ndash; although this will hurt more &ndash; do it on dry skin. Rub until your skin is slightly red with special focus on elbows and heels where the fake tan tends to streak. This is great for getting the blood flow going and sloughing off dead skin, leaving you silky smooth and ready for tanning. Take note! It&rsquo;s not a good idea to use any kind of oil directly before application of the fake tan as this can easily cause streaking and running of product. Moisturise the skin, yes, but make sure you give it 10 minutes to penetrate your skin before applying your home product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep your faux tan lasting longer, keep your skin moisturised and remember that things like body scrubbing, swimming in the salt or chlorinated water, sweating and friction from clothes such as jeans will fade your tan faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TOXIC-FREE SUN SCREEN</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s summer in the UAE but chances are you&rsquo;ll be off on your holidays overseas and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to need sun protection.

(80, 'Baby on the way? Dial a doula to help you through', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Midwives, doctors, loved ones? Who else would you have sharing one of the biggest events of your life: the birth of your baby? Yoga instructor and new mother Cheryl Parsons hired a doula to be with her on delivery day. She reveals more about this growing trend in alternative birthing support&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can hear your first question already. What on earth is a doula and what were they doing at one of the most&nbsp;intimate days of my life? Somewhat unfortunately named, the word&nbsp;&lsquo;doula&rsquo; derives from the Greek word for a female servant. Now while that might conjure up images of someone feeding me grapes and fanning me down during contractions, I can assure you this wasn&rsquo;t the case. A doula is a non-medical birthing support partner who is there to assist a woman before, during and after childbirth. Above all, they aim to create a positive birthing experience. In my case, my doula was a huge support throughout 22 hours&nbsp;of labour for the birth of my first baby, Molly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COUNTDOWN TO SHOW TIME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband and I where just getting into bed last July when, five days past my due date, I felt those all important twinges signaling it was show time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a first-timer like I was,&nbsp;you will ask yourself questions such as: &lsquo;how will I know this is actually happening&rsquo; and &lsquo;what on earth I am supposed to do next?&rsquo; All that and more buzzed through my mind as I picked up the phone to call my doula, Carol Unterhorst, who we had both met with several times in the lead up to &lsquo;D&rsquo; day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had first heard about doulas during my pre-natal yoga teacher training and was intrigued about the thought of bringing someone with me, in addition to the medical team. While healthcare in Dubai is for the most part excellent, I wanted someone extra to help advocate my plan for a natural birth wherever possible, especially given my distance as an expatriate from my core family support. I went along to a monthly meeting of some of Dubai&rsquo;s doulas and instantly felt this was something that would help me feel empowered during my birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as guiding me through the unchartered territory of my first birth, I knew a doula would also give my slightly nervous husband some additional support as to what role&nbsp;he could play. Plus, despite feeling well prepared by my continuous yoga practice, fear was still a major factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;To me, the natural birthing process is a miraculous spiritual experience&nbsp;and it is the reason why I decided to become a doula,&rdquo; explains Carol, who is certified through the Nurturing Birth, an organisation that provides extensive training in the UK and the UAE. &ldquo;Being a doula means I can share and support women to help them achieve a positive birth. Fear is such a big thing in childbirth and it is often manifested&nbsp;through a lack of knowledge, so a key part of being a doula is to ensure the best educational materials are shared with parents to be. As an expat I also truly understand the need for a solid support structure around you especially at one of the most important events of your life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PLEASURE, PAIN AND PUSHING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prenatal vinyasa yoga instructor Jennifer (Wolfe) More also became a doula&nbsp;after the birth of her daughter 14 years ago. She now trains doulas worldwide through her organisation, the Dolphin Yoga and Doula Center. &ldquo;I remember expecting that labour was going to be much easier for me than all of the stories I&rsquo;d heard,&rdquo; Jennifer says. &ldquo;After all I was&nbsp;a yoga instructor and a hypnotherapist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten days after my due date, I found myself in the hospital, hooked up to an IV and being pumped full of medication that was supposed to start my labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That first night in the hospital a nurse came and asked me if I&rsquo;d like a massage and a warm bath,&rdquo; Jennifer says. &ldquo;Those two things, in that moment, were the most pleasurable things I had ever experienced. They kept me going through my 33 hours of labour and three hours of pushing. I&rsquo;ll never forget sitting in a rocking chair after 30 hours and thinking to myself, &lsquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do for the rest of my life. I&rsquo;m going to help people get through this very moment.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve spent the last 13 years doing just that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A doula&rsquo;s role in childbirth is certainly not to replace or take away from that of a midwife or doctor. Indeed, while doulas are meticulously trained in childbirth, they do not have the authority to take medical action or make medical decisions. Their key services are to give educational, psychological and emotional support both before&nbsp;and during the birthing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being a doula has to be one of the most gratifying jobs in the world. As&nbsp;a doula we witness not only the birth&nbsp;of a new life into the world, which is magical and beautiful but we also get to walk with women through the journey of becoming a mother,&rdquo; says Jennifer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMPOWER AND UPLIFT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having this extra core support and help to make informed decisions at such a highly emotional and physical time is one of the main reasons why women turn to doulas. Mother of two Jane Caen also chose Carol as her doula for her second birth: &ldquo;I felt that I was pushed into a totally unnecessary Cesarean Section (CS) with my previous pregnancy by being &lsquo;advised&rsquo; that this was &lsquo;the next step&rsquo; and that it was &lsquo;best for the baby,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I also fell pregnant only three months after my son was born and was determined to have a natural and drug free birth. I saw several OBs but only one was prepared to let me have a natural birth so close to my c-sec operation. I wanted to have someone with me with experience of labour&nbsp;to ensure I would not be railroaded back down the CS route by baffling&nbsp;and frightening warnings of how dangerous it was for the baby,&rdquo; Jane said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It took the stress and pressure off. Just knowing Carol was there helped my labour flow from one stage to the next more naturally. Her presence took away my worry that this could all end in a CS again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While doulas help to advocate a natural, medication-free birth, they are respectful and supporting of&nbsp;every woman&rsquo;s right to have the birth she wants, be that with or without medication. With my own birthing experience clocking in at 22 hours, I credit my strength to the support of my husband and Carol, as well as my wonderful OBGYN, Dr. Rajalakshmi at the American Hospital.

Awakenings asked experts what they&rsquo;ve concluded about the secrets to permanent and healthy weight- loss. Based on treating hundreds of clients with weight issues, what factors are causing body fat issues that aren&rsquo;t recognised by mainstream knowledge? &nbsp;Words by Tamara Pitelen.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HONOUR YOURSELF&nbsp;AND CELEBRATE LIFE<br />\r\nOvereating is a symptom of how you&rsquo;re feeling about yourself, says Theta Healer Vanya Silverten. &ldquo;The number one issue is that people have forgotten how to celebrate life. All the women I see who have weight issues are also suffering low energy and low self-esteem. They&rsquo;re sad in their jobs or they&rsquo;re sad in their relationships and they&rsquo;ve forgotten how to enjoy life. They&rsquo;ve forgotten how to connect to the dance, to the song, to the energy of celebrating all of life, flowers, trees and gratitude and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When you start to celebrate life,&nbsp;you begin to fall in love with life. When you love life, you start to fall in love with yourself and when you love yourself, you start to honour, cherish and celebrate who you are. When you celebrate who you are, you start to do things like exercise, dance, create, and find your joy &ndash; what you don&rsquo;t&nbsp;do is sit on the sofa&nbsp;every night filling your mouth with KFC and packets of biscuits.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Carroll, the co-founder of&nbsp;Kcal Extra, a bespoke meal delivery plan, also believes self-respect is an important factor in weight-loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For me it&rsquo;s respecting yourself and knowing what&rsquo;s going into your body,&rdquo; says Carroll. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have a Lamborghini and put watered down petrol into the fuel tank so why do it to your body? Your body is a gift and it has to last a lifetime. It&rsquo;s the same with drinking and smoking; why would you poison your body? At Kcal, we&rsquo;re about a total lifestyle change.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMOTIONAL EATING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;People put a lot of emotions into food,&rdquo; says Vanya Silverten. &ldquo;We eat when we&rsquo;re angry, when we&rsquo;re happy, on special occasions,&nbsp;when we&rsquo;re stressed or bored or&nbsp;procrastinating&hellip; as a result, people can have a dysfunctional&nbsp;relationship with food. It becomes their comforter and their friend, like a secret friend. It creates a lot of unhealthy&nbsp;emotional attachments to food and the key is getting rid of these attachments. One way to do that is with holistic healing. Opening up the heart chakra is important &ndash; when&nbsp;a person&rsquo;s heart is clogged with negative emotions, they can&rsquo;t feel love, celebrate life or themself. So the heart chakra is major and of course food is linked to emotions and the heart chakra is linked to emotions so if you have disturbances in your heart that&rsquo;s going to be an issue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOURISH YOUR BODY&nbsp;AND SOUL<br />\r\n&ldquo;At Kcal, we strongly believe in the saying &lsquo;let&nbsp;food be thy medicine&rsquo;, because it really changes lives,&rdquo; says Mark Carroll. &ldquo;For us there is a lot more to eating healthy than just losing weight, it goes much deeper. You can look great on the outside but what&rsquo;s going on inside might not be so good. Our clients tell us that all parts of their life improve; their productivity levels, sleeping patterns, the relationship issues, all get better. It&rsquo;s not rocket science, if you put quality, fresh, unprocessed food into your body, you will feel better and it&rsquo;ll show in your eyes, skin, nails and hair as well as your body shape. You&rsquo;re more alive and you have more energy because you&rsquo;re a healthier person generally. The key is good food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When you go and see a doctor, he or she will ask your symptoms and probably give you some pills. The last thing they ask is, &lsquo;what are you eating?&rsquo; but for us this is the most important factor. What&rsquo;s going&nbsp;in to your body? Are you getting enough vitamins and minerals? How are your carbs and proteins? That&rsquo;s why we base Kcal on super foods, there&rsquo;s a lot of broccoli and&nbsp;green beans, fish and salmon &ndash; the best of the best. My Kcal business partner and me haven&rsquo;t been sick in a decade. You can cure disease with food, it&rsquo;s powerful stuff. Your diet and lifestyle that can bring on illness. People underestimate the power of food &ndash; both the incredible power of food to heal but also the massively harmful effects of eating the wrong foods.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOXINS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Another reason I&rsquo;ve found that people often don&rsquo;t lose weight is because fat cells are holding onto toxins inside the body,&rdquo; says Vanya Silverten. &ldquo;We get poisoned everyday with radiation, bad food, chemicals, pollutants and so on, so we have toxins in the body but sometimes the body doesn&rsquo;t know to do with these toxins in order to prevent them getting into your organs where they could really do some damage. So the body shoves these toxins into fat&nbsp;cells and the fat wraps around the toxins&nbsp;to protect your body from them. Many people are surprisingly toxic so even though they&rsquo;re eating healthily, the weight won&rsquo;t shift because the body is holding onto the fat to protect itself. For this reason, gentle detoxing and cleanses are important, food cleanses, bowel and liver cleanses, saunas, all that kind of thing will help with detoxing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONSISTENCY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the big efforts you make once in a while that counts, it&rsquo;s the consistent efforts every day that make the difference, says Mark Carroll. &ldquo;For us the fundamentals of weight-loss are consistency and willpower to avoid the many temptations of life in Dubai. Remove all temptation out of your house &ndash; don&rsquo;t keep chocolate bars, bread, crisps, soft drinks and so on in your home. Shop for quality food and keep everything else out. Nothing else is needed but water.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning and preparation is key, says Carroll. &ldquo;Set monthly goals and weigh yourself weekly to keep track of things. Also, plan your food. Know exactly what you&rsquo;re going to eat and when you&rsquo;re going to eat it. This is a massive problem in Dubai, skipping meals and then turning to junk food because you&rsquo;re starving and there&rsquo;s nothing else easily available.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CARBOHYDRATE CONTROL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re talking about weight loss its&nbsp;not just about the calories, it&rsquo;s about the carbohydrates,&rdquo; says Mark Carroll. &ldquo;If you want to lose weight, you should take a maximum of 40 to 60 grams of carbs a day. Avoid bread; don&rsquo;t even touch bread. And white rice. Not all calories are created equal so don&rsquo;t focus only on counting calories &ndash; the quality of the food is paramount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve grown up in a fast food world and convinced ourselves it&rsquo;s normal. It&rsquo;s not. Never in the thousands of years of human history have we fed ourselves with the processed, chemical-added junk that we have in the last 20 years even as all around us rates of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, obesity, heart attacks&nbsp;are skyrocketing. It doesn&rsquo;t help that we&rsquo;re bombarded with media images that suggest we&rsquo;ll be more popular and have more fun if we eat this brand of fried chicken or whatever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT TO EAT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We think there&rsquo;s nothing better than going back to our ancestors and following the&nbsp;paleo diet, also known as the caveman diet,&rdquo; says Mark Carroll. &ldquo;That is, eating the food we were eating centuries ago &ndash; vegetables, organic meat and fish, fruit and nuts. Eating what grows off the earth. If it&rsquo;s come out of the ground or off a plant, it&rsquo;s ok. No bread, processed foods, bad carbs and so on. This is our theory and for us it&rsquo;s working very well. Keep it natural and stay away from the junk.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One of the best diets I&rsquo;ve come&nbsp;across is eating fruit till noon, followed&nbsp;by a good lunch that&rsquo;s divided into three, carbohydrates, vegetables and protein,&rdquo; says Vanya Silverten. &ldquo;Then in the evening have something similar and try to finish eating before 8pm. People shed fat quite easily this way and they don&rsquo;t have sugar imbalances because they&rsquo;re getting all the nutrients. Don&rsquo;t starve yourself and include&nbsp;lots of different colours in your diet, reds, greens, yellows, oranges, and pinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Traditional restrictive diets are punishing and miserable, they do not celebrate life but people don&rsquo;t know another way because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been told through countless media articles. The&nbsp;first thing I&rsquo;d tell people who want to lose weight is to stop reading those magazines and books, stop buying so-called diet food, stop buying all those tricks that claim to&nbsp;lose weight. Let it go and start to celebrate who you are. Eat well, sleep well, nourish yourself, love yourself, care for yourself and celebrate &ndash; maybe dance, sing, or paint. When I see people who sink into depression, they&rsquo;ve forgotten how to be creative, they&rsquo;ve forgotten their creative energy &ndash; finding that energy will bring new life to you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Vanya Silverten is a London-based Theta Healer who regularly visits Dubai.

(82, 'Confessions of a Reformed Shampoo Addict', 'body', 'beauty', 'beauty', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Asma Merchant went cold turkey on shampoo &ndash; and the world didn&rsquo;t end! She explains how and why&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always had a chronic love affair with shampoos. I would stand in the beauty aisles of supermarkets for hours,&nbsp;lusting over the bottles, reading the multiple miracle adjectives that these magical concoctions were promising to offer to me. Even though I never really ended up with bouncing, shiny curls or sleek, straight tresses, it was a thrill when my shampoo and conditioner bottles would be nearly ending so that I could buy new ones to try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JOURNEY TO &lsquo;NO-POO&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the journey to being more conscious of what I was putting in and on my body, I read&nbsp;articles about the harmful effects of Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS), which is a foaming agent and gives us the lather we love. It is actually a cheap industrial detergent and hence is utilised freely by manufacturers despite any potential harmful consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SLS is one of the key ingredients in nearly every personal care product we use including soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, shower gels, face wash etc. In fact, I went through every single bottle of shampoo and shower gel in my local hypermarket and every one of them contains SLS. It shattered my shampoo fantasies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I headed to the pharmacy and&nbsp;picked a bottle of SLS-free shampoo which by far was one of the worst experiences ever &nbsp;because it just doesn&rsquo;t lather and I never got the feeling that I had washed&nbsp;my hair. I was willing to unhappily live with it but frankly the SLS free shampoos do have other ingredients that are rather questionable. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then the universe heard my plea and ta-da, I stumbled upon the &lsquo;no-poo&rsquo; method. Even though I question the genius who came up with the name, the method is infallibly easy, cost-effective and chemical free. All you need is two empty bottles and three simple ingredients; water, baking soda and apple cider vinegar (ACV).&nbsp;The best part is it works on coloured or chemically treated hair too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE LOGIC BEHIND IT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our logic behind the traditional hair care routine is shampoo washes and conditioner moisturises. What actually takes place<br />\r\nis something more sinister. Our hair produces an oily substance called sebum to protect and nourish each individual strand of hair and give it the lively look. What shampoo basically does is strip the hair of its natural oil along with the dirt and grime which is why the conditioner is required &ndash; to replenish what the shampoo stripped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time this stripping causes breakage and damage and internally the scalp produces more and more oil to compensate for the shampoo&rsquo;s action. This is why most people have to wash their hair daily or&nbsp;every alternate day or their hair feels greasy or dirty. What this method aims to do is regulate the oil production and reduce the need for such frequent washing. The plan is to &nbsp;wash hair only once a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baking soda is a natural cleanser and&nbsp;it helps in removing the dirt while the&nbsp;acidic content of the Apple Cider Vinegar nourishes, balances hair&rsquo;s pH level and seals the cuticle. As this does not strip the hair&rsquo;s natural coating, our scalp doesn&rsquo;t have to produce the oil it previously required. But until our scalp adjusts itself to produce less oil, we have to go through a few weeks of excess oiliness in our hair (check cheat sheet).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of being excited about shampoo shopping, I now love heading into the kitchen and making my own shampoo. And my hair has never been better. That&rsquo;s right! I&rsquo;m serious. My hair looks great. In the beginning, it does cause nightmarishly oily hair but if you persist through it, there is low maintenance, chemical free hair at the other end, which believe me<br />\r\nis worth the weird stares that I get when I tell people I haven&rsquo;t shampooed in months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE RECIPE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shampoo (one bottle will easily last you a month)<br />\r\n&bull; 2 T of Baking soda (Note: baking powder&nbsp;is NOT the same as baking soda)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>8 oz water</li>\r\n	<li>A squeezy bottle (ex-Mayo bottles qualify)Mix ingredients and give the bottle a good shake. Wet hair with warm/hot water. Squeeze a small amount on to the scalp and give your scalp a good massage and leave it in for a few minutes. Rinse.\r\n	<p>Conditioner (this bottle is also enough for a month)<br />\r\n	&bull; 2T of Apple Cider Vinegar<br />\r\n	&bull; 8oz water</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&bull; A squeezy bottle<br />\r\n	&bull; Optional 5-8 drops of any essential&nbsp;oil (if you miss the smell of commercial fragrance in the shampoo)</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>After the shampoo, pour this mix on to the ends of your hair and leave it for a few minutes. Rinse but with cold water so the cuticle of your hair seals giving it a good shine. The ACV does not leave any smell whatsoever when rinsed but you can add any essential oil if you cannot bear the smell at all.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Note that these measurements are relative. You will need to do a bit of trial and error to figure out the perfect mix for you. If your hair feels unclean, add more baking soda to the shampoo. If hair feels dried out or the scalp is itchy then use less baking soda and more ACV. Use less ACV conditioner if your hair feels oily<br />\r\n	or sticky.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHEAT SHEET</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;no poo&rsquo; method aims to regulate the hair&rsquo;s oil production and reduce the need for such frequent washing. The plan is to wash hair only once a week. But the transition period can be tough, here&rsquo;s our guide to getting through the first week or two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dealing with oily hair in the adjustment period</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do not over wash your hair no matter how much you are tempted. If need be just rinse your hair with plain water.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Start this experiment at a time when you don&rsquo;t have too many social engagements.</li>\r\n	<li>Just like any other bad hair day, tie ponytails or uses carves or hats.</li>\r\n	<li>Dryshampoo&ndash;sprinkleyourhairwithcornstarch(if you have light hair) or cornstarch and&nbsp;cocoa powder (for darker hair) overnight. Talcum powder is another option.</li>\r\n	<li>Another option&ndash;mix a quarter cup of cornstarch with a quarter cup of rubbing alcohol and&nbsp;one cup water. Spray into hair and let it dry.I have used all of these &lsquo;cheats&rsquo; and attended social parties with hair not washed for three days and with the cocoa powder and cornstarch concoction in my hair. Believe me it works and no one even notices.\r\n	<p>Cost wise</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>I have bought shampoos from every imaginable place supermarkets, beauty centres, pharmacies, salons, organic stores. I wish I had checked my grocery store first!<br />\r\n	Regular &ndash; AED 28, SLS free &ndash; AED 110, Professional range &ndash; AED 160, Organic variety &ndash; AED 200. On the other hand, a 200gm box of baking soda is AED 5.95 and a massive one litre bottle of Organic Apple Cider Vinegar costs AED 22.50 which will probably last me for a few years. Do you see the difference?</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'hair-washing-1024x547.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:23:51'),

About 60 per&nbsp;cent of everything you put on your skin is absorbed into your bloodstream and from there it can end up in your liver, brain&hellip; anywhere. Holistic beautician Katrina Valente reveals the top five biggest baddies in skin product ingredients.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your skin is a huge sponge that absorbs anything placed on it. That&rsquo;s why hormone therapy treatments and smoking cessation medications are often patches applied directly to the skin; it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;quick way to get them into your system via the sponge that is your skin. But what other toxins and allergens are getting into your cells, organs and tissues through your skin? A study conducted in 2006 by Chemical Safe Skin Care found we absorb about 2.5kg of toxic waste each year from our bath, body and skin&nbsp;products. What are the top toxins? Read on&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parabens</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A class of chemicals widely used&nbsp;as preservatives by cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, parabens are increasingly controversial because they have been found in breast cancer tumours (an average of 20 nanograms/g of tissue)&nbsp;and can mimic estrogen (a hormone known to play a role in the development of breast cancer), however no official link to the disease has been established.&nbsp;Used to fight bacteria and fungus, parabens in your everyday products are listed as Ethyl, Methyl, Propyl, Isopropyl, Butyl or Isobutyl Parabens and are&nbsp;used both internally and externally in pharmaceutical liquid supplements. They are also suspected of causing reproductive p2roblems and lowering sperm count in men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial fragrances</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These can contain wide varieties of harmful ingredients that may include phthalates, petrochemicals, benzene, toluene, xylene, methanol to name but a few! Phthalates have been proved to be endocrine disruptors because they mimic estrogen in the body. Higher estrogen exposures are&nbsp;holistic beauty linked to higher risk of breast cancer. The&nbsp;additional danger of artificial fragrances is that they are absorbed through the skin as well as being inhaled. Inhalation absorption is much quicker than products a3bsorbed through the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial foaming agents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known as Sodium Lauryl and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLS), this foaming&nbsp;agent is found in products such as liquid soaps, toothpastes, shampoos and bubble baths. It makes us feel like our product is working properly if there&rsquo;s lots of foam. It doesn&rsquo;t. Lots of foam just looks good. SLS is among the the most commonly used harmful chemicals in mainstream body care products. It&rsquo;s a known skin irritant, hormone and endocrine disruptor and suspected carcinogen. The less a product foams, the better it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commonly used as a preservative in skin and body products in the US but banned in the European Union, BHA is carcinogenic and causes pigment loss, which is why it&rsquo;s a common ingredient in skin lightening products. Use lemon juice instead if y5ou&rsquo;re determined to lighten your skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petrochemicals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid anything with the word &lsaquo;petro&rsaquo; in it and,&nbsp;yes, this includes Vaseline aka petroleum jelly! (I know that&rsquo;s controversial.) Used widely in lip balms and ointments, petrochemicals are toxic, readily available and very cheap for manufacturers. Choose organic products for your lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After all&rsquo;s said and done however, we at&nbsp;<em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;mag don&rsquo;t advocate getting too hung up on all this &ndash; hysteria and fear is not the way forward. Honour your amazing body by putting things in it and on it that nourish and nurture&nbsp;it. Self-love is not about slathering yourself in chemicals to make wrinkles vanish, pigment fade or your skin tighten and darken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be mindful when choosing your skin, hair and bath products and choose quality, organic products that won&rsquo;t hurt you or our planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SKIN CARE RESOURCES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired to find out more about the potentially harmful chemicals that could be getting into your body via your skin?

A term used to describe beauty companies that position themselves as leaders in the fight against breast cancer while engaging in practices that may be contributing to rising rates of the disease, such as including suspected carcinogens into their products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO TRY THIS AT HOME! DIY HAIR CONDITIONING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a deep conditioning treatment, massage a little olive oil or almond oil into your scalp then smooth a little through to the ends of your hair. Put a shower cap on and then on top of that put a woolly hat. This keeps in the heat, which opens the pores and penetrates the scalp leaving you with silky smooth hair. Leave on for 20 to 30 minutes.

In essence, that&rsquo;s what almost all of us are doing but we have</p>\r\n\r\n<p>been doing it for such a long time, we don&rsquo;t realize that we&rsquo;re off balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this day and age, many of us slouch at our desks or on the sofa, drive for long hours, sit cross-legged, lift heavy objects etc. All these activities cause a difference in our leg length that causes imbalance, not only in the lower body but also in the hip, spine, shoulders, neck and jaw. You may not have any painful symptoms now but such an imbalance can be harmful in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dorn Method is a self-help technique aimed at easing muscle-skeletal pains and aches resulting from leg length differences and/or misalignment in the spine. Karima Nanji, a Dorn Therapist at SpaDunya Club, has been practicing this method for the last four years. &ldquo;Even though Dorn does not replace traditional medicine,&rdquo; Nanji says, &ldquo;I have seen it help alleviate severe back pains, menstrual cramps, sciatica and even slipped disc-related pain. It helped<br />\r\na lot in case of my daughter who suffers from scoliosis &ndash; although early detection of scoliosis is crucial with this method.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More empowering than other forms of osteopathic and chiropractic treatment, the Dorn method involves dynamic movements that include the patient as opposed to having a treatment done to them. Also, Dorn therapy is gentle in&nbsp;its approach and does not involve any manipulation or cracking of joints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical treatment starts with a leg length assessment followed by exercises to bring the leg length back into alignment. The alignment of the hip bone, shoulders and jaw is also checked along with a manual examination of the spine, vertebrae by vertebrae. The final step is a relaxing Breuss massage of the spine, which aligns any blockages and soothes any aches or pains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>QUICK QUESTIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q.

Is this for me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dorn method is suitable for anyone looking to align their body or improve their posture or anyone suffering from pain in the legs, hip, back, shoulder, sciatica, neck etc. It is not suitable for paralysis and you should wait hree months after surgery to have a session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. Will it hurt?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The therapy is gentle and may feel like a strenuous workout afterwards. If you are already suffering from pain, then the therapist will ensure that the movements are limited to the patient pain threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. How many sessions do I need?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will see improvement in the leg length and spinal alignment within two sessions but you may need more depending on the severity of the condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. Where in UAE can I go for Dorn treatment? And how much does it cost?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Karima Nanji is an AHHAI certified Dorn Method and PIDDDS Master practitioner.

I have never complained much about back pain so I wasn&rsquo;t sure about what I would get out of this session. The session started off with a relaxing cup of beetroot tea as Dorn therapist Karima Nanji explained how she integrates SpaDunya&rsquo;s signature colour therapy with Dorn. I am asked to pick four colours out of an array of fourteen, these were then sprayed one after the other on my palms and I inhaled three to five times. She then explained what each color meant for me and where the blockages could be related. Next, Karima showed me the difference in my leg length. I had really noticed it before but the left and right sides of my hip, shoulders, jaw and hairline were not in a straight line. In short, I was lopsided but happily Karima assured me that such a slight difference can be fixed within two sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She showed me a few exercises which I could do at home which would keep the difference in check. All the exercises were gentle &ndash; no cracking or popping of joints involved. This was followed by a gentle massage of the spine using Altearah Bio oils and a relaxing lie-in with hot stones on my back. Aaaah bliss! After this, checked my entire spine vertebrae by vertebrae to see if there were any blockages or issues from sacrum right to my ears. This was all corrected through gentle movements and exercises. I saw a marked difference in the leg length within the first session and I feel that my posture is much better and back much straighter. This is a must-do for not only people with back issues but for anyone and everyone wanting to avoid them down the track and for better posture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FACTS ABOUT DORN METHOD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dorn Method was developed by German Dieter Dorn in the 1970s. Dieter says every organ in the body lies on a meridian that connects to the spine, which means that easing out blockages in the spine helps heal diseases of the corresponding organ. This translates to the energy body and treating the misaligned vertebrae would clear the corresponding chakras and its emotional issues.</p>\r\n', 'back-pain-682x1024.jpg', '2019-07-27 07:31:50'),
(86, 'The 30-Day Bikram Yoga Challenge', 'body', 'body', 'yoga', '', 'fitness', '<p><em><strong>The yoga gauntlet has been thrown! Can Tamara Pitelen survive 30 day of hot, sweaty Bikram Yoga?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m really going to do it. I am really going to commit the next 30 days to the daily practice of yoga in sauna-like conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why on earth?&rsquo; you might justifiably ask. Because I&rsquo;ve heard that the intense heat that makes Bikram yoga different from the other varieties of yoga is amazing for getting rid of toxins, increasing flexibility faster and getting toned up and slimmed down in double quick time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bikram yoga is basically a sequence&nbsp;of 26 traditional Hatha yoga postures that takes 90 minutes but the crucial difference to other types of yoga is that it&rsquo;s done in a room heated to 41 degrees celsius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, the sequence of postures and the heated room will warm and stretch your muscles, ligaments and tendons in the order in which they should be stretched and the heat takes the trauma out of stretching, heals and helps prevent injuries. It also promotes sweating which helps flush toxins from the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which is all very well and good but can I do it every day for 30 days? Will it kill me or make me stronger? I guess we&rsquo;ll find out&hellip; my first class is tonight after work, and yes, I&rsquo;m a little scared. I&rsquo;ve done Bikram only one&nbsp;other time in my life, that was 12 years ago and I swore you&rsquo;d never catch me stepping foot in one of these sauna torture chambers again. Never say never.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day one: One down, 29 to go.<br />\r\nI won&rsquo;t lie, it wasn&rsquo;t pretty. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t pretty by the end of it &ndash; unless you fancy women covered in sweat with mascara and eyeliner running down faces the colour&nbsp;of beetroot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&rsquo;Intense&rsquo; is one word for the experience, &lsquo;hardcore&rsquo; is another and &lsquo;painful and miserable&rsquo; could be thrown about as<br />\r\nwell. There were a couple of times when I thought I might throw up (especially in the camel pose) or pass out from the heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t the only one though. There were about 35 of us in the class, packed in like sardines mat to mat and other Bikram beginners were falling about around me like pins at the end of a bowling alley. Those who thought they were about to faint had to just stop and sit for a while&hellip; but anyone who sat too long was soon given a bit of a telling off by the teacher who would make an excellent boot camp instructor or drill sergeant. He&rsquo;s of the &lsquo;get up, don&rsquo;t be so lazy, this is good for you and you will do it&rsquo; school of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made it to the end but the last half hour was brutal. The words going through my head were, &lsquo;please God, make it stop, please God, make it stop&hellip;&rsquo;. At the end, I could literally wring the sweat out of every stitch of clothing I had on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why am I doing it again? Oh yes, because apparently it&rsquo;ll clear out a load of toxins, get me flexible in super quick time and help lose weight&hellip; cling to that thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day three: Tired. Oh so tired.<br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve got my third Bikram class in about two hours from now. The not so good news is that right now I&rsquo;m feeling exhausted, nodding off in the office over my keyboard. And it&rsquo;s only day three! But the good news is that I got through the whole second class yesterday without having to sit out any of the postures. So maybe you do acclimatise to the heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s still hard going though. And the teacher doesn&rsquo;t suffer any shenanigans. He told one guy that he was like &ldquo;a fidgety three year old&rdquo; and the woman next to me was berated for bringing her mobile phone into class, &ldquo;we do not bring mobile phones into class! You can live without it for 90 minutes. I lived most of my life quite happily before the invention of mobile phones&hellip;&rdquo; Then,&nbsp;when a man stood up to leave the room because he was finding the heat too much, the teacher said, &ldquo;Where are you going? Sit back down! Do not leave the room, commit to at least staying in the room for the whole 90 minutes, even if you have to lie down&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite his grumblings, I like this teacher though. He&rsquo;s clearly passionate about Bikram yoga and he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. He&rsquo;s like Bikram&rsquo;s version of Dr House. Questionable bedside manner but endearing in a grouchy kind of way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as surviving the class though, here&rsquo;s a tip. Don&rsquo;t wear too much. My regular yoga class clothes are too heavy for Bikram. A light-weight singlet t-shirt and shorts is best. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t wear tracksuit pants or a heavy baggy t-shirt unless you want to die of heat exhaustion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don&rsquo;t wear white unless you&rsquo;re happy for everyone to be able to see through your clothes by the end of the class once they&rsquo;re dripping with sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day four: Hang in there<br />\r\nI&rsquo;ve done four classes now and it doesn&rsquo;t seem any easier. For the last 20 minutes of the class, I am hanging on with the last dregs of my emotional and physical strength. I&nbsp;watched a documentary on telly the other night about the amazing power of&nbsp;the brain and visualisation for managing physical pain so in the really tough moments I&rsquo;ve been imagining myself encased in a block of ice in the hope that it might make the intense heat more bearable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No joy so far. Although last night after class, I overheard the teacher tell another new guy &lsquo;not to worry because it does get easier&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get&rsquo;s easier!? I wanted to grab the teacher by the collar and scream &ldquo;WHEN? In the name of all that&rsquo;s Holy, WHEN does it get easier?&rdquo; This other new guy had struggled&nbsp;through the class. He spent most of it just sitting on his mat, sweating profusely. Apparently it was his third class but he&rsquo;d found this one was much harder than the first two. The teacher told him to persevere for about 10 classes, that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;ll be easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day seven: Breakthrough<br />\r\nI might have turned a corner with this Bikram thing. Ok, maybe not turned a corner exactly but veered off in a corner-like direction&hellip; because today&rsquo;s class was nowhere near the nightmare of hideousness that my first class was just one week ago. Although, that could also be because today&rsquo;s class was&nbsp;a 9am Saturday class which means it had&nbsp;less than half the number of people in it that you get on a weekday after work class. And when you&rsquo;ve got a room jam-packed with people standing mat to mat, all red-faced&nbsp;and sweating buckets, they turn the place into even more of a sauna. We had a lovely Australian instructor who gave me some helpful corrections on my postures and mentioned what some postures were good for. For example, one pose is great for weight management and another pose stimulates your thyroid gland. Which has to be a good thing. I picked up a pamphlet from the reception desk today, it&rsquo;s one of those &lsquo;About Bikram&rsquo; things. Apparently, Bikram yoga&nbsp;was created by an Indian man called Bikram Choudhury who started studying yoga at age three. (Age three! I was still stuffing rattles in my mouth and mashing banana into carpets at age three.) By age 13, Bikram was the youngest National India Yoga Champion and he kept the title for three years but at the age of 20 he shattered his knee in an accident and that&rsquo;s when, with the help of his friend Bishnu Ghosh, he designed a series of postures for rehabilitation. And Bikram yoga was born. The heated room is for warming the muscles and allowing you to work for deeply and safely into the various postures. Heat takes the trauma out of stretching as well as heals and prevents injuries. (All of this description is what I&rsquo;m reading on the pamphlet). Then comes the really good bit. According to the pamphlet, the regular practice of Bikram&nbsp;will do many great things, these include&nbsp;eliminate toxins, reduce cholesterol, tone&nbsp;and strengthen muscles, strengthen bones, improve flexibility, reduce stress as well as achieve and maintain your proper body weight. This last one is particularly exciting and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that even after just a week, I can tell that my waist is getting trimmer. I won&rsquo;t weigh myself till the end of the month so won&rsquo;t know officially till then but my jeans are definitely looser. So, on we go&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day eight: Reality slap<br />\r\nJust when I thought I was getting a bit better at this Bikram yoga thing, Bam! I receive a reality slap to the head re my progress that&nbsp;is akin to being rugby tackled by a rhino. Tonight&rsquo;s eighth class was a return to the almost unbearable hideousness of that first class. Towards the end of the class, it almost feels like you&rsquo;re on fire on the inside. My heart was pounding, my skin was burning,<br />\r\nI had mascara dripping off my chin, I felt nauseous during camel pose and I was thinking very, very bad thoughts about the teacher. I wasn&rsquo;t the only one suffering, all around me, people were dropping like flies, but the teacher was relentless, &ldquo;come on, stand up, you can do this, you&rsquo;ve been sitting long enough&hellip;&rdquo; he said to whoever paused for a rest. And God help anyone who actually&nbsp;tried to leave the room. Why am I doing this again? Time to re-read that list of benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 10: One third of the way<br />\r\nI did my tenth class tonight (break out&nbsp;the aloe vera juice!) and I got my first&nbsp;sense that I might actually enjoy this hot, sweaty, bendy stuff one day. It&rsquo;s like when I first started running. I was quite a serious runner for a few years there but when I first started, I remember it took about six months of huffing and puffing around&nbsp;the streets near my home and getting my fitness up before I started to enjoy running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, according to the official Bikram Yoga website (www.bikramyoga. com), as a beginner, It takes three classes<br />\r\nfor your body to understand the proper approach to the posture, and ten classes for your body to begin to work with postures. So, I&rsquo;ve reached a milestone! However, the website also stated that a beginner should practice Bikram every day for two months. Every day for two months! I don&rsquo;t know how anyone with a job to hold down or a family to raise could manage 60 days in a row.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 25: Home stretch<br />\r\nJust five more days before the challenge&nbsp;is won! Though I probably shouldn&rsquo;t get too cocky just yet, not until all 30 are done&nbsp;and dusted. So, how do I feel? Really good although no dramatic transformation has taken place however I like to think that all sorts of wonderful stuff is happening on the inside that will soon show on the outside. Having said that, I can handle the heat better now and do most of the&nbsp;26 Hatha postures better than I did at the start. Some poses I can do quite a lot better but on a couple I&rsquo;ve seen no improvement at all that I can tell, namely Tree Pose (Tadasana), which is the posture my body just doesn&rsquo;t want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish line! 30 classes down<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s it then. Did it. Thirty days of Bikram yoga ticked off. Am I bendier? Yes, definitely. In the last two nights I stretched deeper than ever into postures like the forward bend when you try and get the top of your head on the ground &ndash; for the first time ever, I did get the crown of my head on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a couple of other poses though,&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;ve made any progress, namely Tree Pose (Tadasana) and Fixed Firm<br />\r\nPose (Supta-Vajrasana). It&rsquo;s my hips. More precisely, it&rsquo;s what about 20 odd years of running has done to my hips. That is, welded them together tight. It&rsquo;s going to take a fair&nbsp;bit of work to loosen them up and until I do I can forget any hope of moving on from Tree Pose into an advanced posture like Toe Stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I&rsquo;m hooked on Bikram now and enjoy the classes &ndash; I definitely couldn&rsquo;t say that in the first couple of weeks, back then it was just a case of making it through to the end without fainting or crying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had hoped for some kind of miraculous physical transformation after 30 classes. I didn&rsquo;t get that and it was probably unrealistic anyway. I&rsquo;m stronger, more flexible and a little lighter but the kind of transformation I was hoping for takes months or years of practice. Better get on with it then I guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BIKRAM BASICS IN A NUTSHELL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT IS IT? A sequence of 26 Hatha poses done over 90 minutes in a room heated to 41 degrees Celsius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHO DEVELOPED IT? Indian man Bikram Choudhury, a National India Yoga Champion who started studying yoga at age three. At the age of 20, Bikram shattered his knee in an accident so, with the help of his friend Bishnu Ghosh, designed a series of postures for rehabilitation. Bikram yoga was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHY THE HOT ROOM? The heated room is for warming the muscles and allowing you to work deeply and safely into the various postures. Heat takes the trauma out of stretching as well as heals and prevents injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BIKRAM? According to Bikram, the regular practice of this &lsquo;hot yoga&rsquo; will do many great things for your mind and body including eliminate toxins, reduce cholesterol, tone and strengthen muscles, strengthen bones, improve flexibility, reduce stress as well as achieve and maintain your proper body wei</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOP TIPS FOR SURVIVING BIKRAM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wear as little as possible: Leave your body issues at the door because covering up in baggy t-shirts and long sweatpants will make the class 100 times harder. You don&rsquo;t want that. Light-weight singlets and shorts are best. No one is looking at you, they&rsquo;re all in their own Bikram bubble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early weekend classes are easier:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more people in the room, the hotter it is so while you&rsquo;re still a beginner and acclimatising to the heat, go to the quieter classes, like 9am&nbsp;on a Friday or Saturday. The 6pm and 8pm classes on a weekday are the ones often packed to the rafters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t wipe sweat away: A lot of beginners who aren&rsquo;t used to the rivers of sweat running down their face and body spend a lot of time wiping it away. Don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;ll make you hotter. Sweat is good. Let the sweat run where it may, it&rsquo;s the body&rsquo;s cooling system. By wiping it away, you&rsquo;re making your body work even harder to create more sweat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fidget-free zone: Don&rsquo;t fidget with your hair, clothes, towel etc. Don&rsquo;t itch, scratch, rub&hellip; it wastes energy, makes you hotter and distracts others from their practice. Keep single- minded focus on doing the poses and between poses keep still and calm, staring straight ahead at yourself in the mirror while listening for the next set of instructions from the teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t drink a lot during the class: It may seem odd but during the class is not the time to drink a lot of water &ndash; it could come back up during some of the poses. A few sips are ok but most of your water drinking should be done in the hours before and after the class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t eat before class: Leave a good two hours between your last meal and your Bikram class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IN THE UAE, BIKRAM OR HOT YOGA IS HELD AT:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bikram Yoga Middle East, TECOM, Dubai</strong><br />\r\nA new Bikram studio in TECOM, Dubai.

(87, 'Dying to be me â€“ Anita Moorjani', 'body', 'featured', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>The amazing story of how one woman&rsquo;s Near Death Experience helped her heal from cancer by releasing fear and unconditionally loving herself. Tamara Pitelen interview Anita Moorjani, author of Dying to Be Me.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2006, after a four-year fight with cancer, Anita Moorjani was in a coma and virtually dead&hellip; but instead of dying, as the doctors predicted, she woke from the coma and &ndash; miraculously &ndash; was completely free of the devastating cancer that had destroyed her body. What happened, she says, is that she visited the &lsquo;other side&rsquo; where she received a profound understanding about why she had developed cancer. With that clarity came healing and today, seven years later, she enjoys full health and happiness. While in Dubai recently, Anita sat down with Awakenings magazine to recount the incredible story of what happened while she was &lsquo;dead&rsquo;; how that Near Death Experience saved her life, and the important message she came back to share with the rest of us.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had to sum up in one word why I got cancer &ndash; that word would be &lsquo;fear&rsquo;. I was diagnosed with lymphatic&nbsp;cancer in 2002. By December 2005, I was in Intensive Care. I weighed 85 pounds and my muscles had deteriorated to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t walk or hold up my own head. I had egg-sized tumours from the base of my skull, all around my neck, under my arms and in my chest, all the way down to my abdomen. I had fluid in the brain as well as open, weeping skin lesions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My lungs were filled with fluid so&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe without an oxygen tank. I was no longer absorbing food so nutrition was by way of a tube through my throat. There was one tube in my nose for oxygen and one in my throat for food. I was in a bad way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THROUGH THE VEIL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctor told my husband that I had three months to live, at best, but six weeks later I went into a coma. My family was told that these were my final hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while everyone around me&nbsp;thought I was in a coma, I had never felt so incredible, so alive and so beautifully calm. I was aware of everything that was happening around me, I knew what the doctors were doing and I could hear conversations they&nbsp;were having up the corridor, I was aware of how upset my family were. I was also aware of my brother in India trying frantically to getonaflighttocomeandseemeandI could feel what everyone was feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also aware of being supported and guided by other non-physical beings, including the spirit of my father who had died 10 years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to comprehend when you live in a physical body but in that realm&nbsp;I was aware of everything at once and everything made complete sense. Without the boundaries of my physical body, it was like I existed everywhere. I expanded; my consciousness had no bounds. I was no longer my physical body, I was no longer in pain. The cancer was all gone and it was the most incredible feeling. I felt no attachment to my limp body, I felt free, liberated and magnificent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEING LOVE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then had a sense of what I can only describe as pure, unconditional love in a way I never have before. I felt renewed, like I had come home and I saw with crystal- clear clarity how all the choices I&rsquo;d made in my life had led me to cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this &lsquo;all-seeing&rsquo; perspective, I understood that the reason I got ill was through living my whole life out of fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear can be very subtle and living from a place of fear means that every small decision you make, all your choices, are made out of a fear of&nbsp;the consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was me. For example, I feared what people thought of me so I was a people pleaser. If I did nice things for people, it wasn&rsquo;t because it brought me joy, it was because I wanted them to like me. Same with the jobs I did. I worked out of fear of not having enough money, fear of being a loser. I believed I had to pursue this, chase that, get ahead. Ironically, I was paranoid about getting cancer so I was vegan and I consumed only organic foods. I was into macrobiotics and vitamin supplements, I even grew my own wheatgrass for juicing! I was obsessive about food but not because I loved my&nbsp;life, my body or my health but because I&nbsp;feared illness, I feared getting cancer. So the big clarity for me was, &lsquo;Oh my goodness, all I have to do is love myself, love my life and make my choices out of love not fear.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you can&rsquo;t just say, &lsquo;ok, I&rsquo;m going to stop fearing&rsquo;. Fear has to be replaced and what it must be replaced with is self-love. While in this other realm, I learned that the reason I was so fearful was that I didn&rsquo;t love myself enough. The more you love yourself, the less room there is&nbsp;for fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ALWAYS THE OUTSIDER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My lack of self-love stemmed from always feeling that I didn&rsquo;t fit in, I was always&nbsp;an outsider. I was the only Indian kid in&nbsp;a British school in Hong Kong. The kids in my building were Chinese, no matter where I went I felt I didn&rsquo;t belong. I always tried hard to be accepted and I was bullied because I was a different race, a different culture with different values. For example, if I went to a British kid&rsquo;s home, they ate with a fork and knife. If I brought that child to my home, my parents ate with their fingers and British kids were taught that picking up food with our hands was dirty; so there was always this feeling of being inferior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this new profound clarity of how a lack of self-love had manifested in me as cancer, I understood that the cancer was not some punishment for anything I&rsquo;d done wrong, nor was it bad karma. Where I was at that point in time was a culmination<br />\r\nof every decision, every choice and every thought of my entire life. My many fears and my great power had manifested as&nbsp;this disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also knew that, now that I&rsquo;d understood the magnificence of my true self, that my body would heal rapidly if I chose to go back to life. I understood that my body is only a reflection of my internal state. If my inner self were aware of its magnificence and connection with All- That-Is, my body would soon reflect that and heal rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STAY OR GO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was my father&rsquo;s spirit who communicated to me that I had the choice whether to go back into my body or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, &lsquo;Sweetheart, I want you to know that it&rsquo;s not your time to come home yet.&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s still your choice whether you want to come with me or go back into your body.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t want to come back because my body was dying and had caused so much suffering to my family and me but I also knew that my body would heal very quickly now that I understood everything. I knew too that I had a job still to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard my father say, &lsquo;Now that you know the truth of who you really are, go back and live your life fearlessly!&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I did and my recovery completely astounded the doctors. Just four days after coming out of the coma, my tumours had shrunk by 70 per cent and the fluid in my lungs had receded so they moved me out&nbsp;of ICU and into a regular room. Within&nbsp;five weeks I was strong enough to go home and despite a barrage of tests, the doctors couldn&rsquo;t find a trace of cancer. They couldn&rsquo;t explain it. The oncologist said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what to write in your medical file, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIVING FEARLESSLY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven years later, Anita enjoys optimum health and happiness. She lives life fearlessly; doing only what brings her&nbsp;joy. Her life&rsquo;s purpose is to spread the message she learnt during her Near Death Experience, which is the importance of living fearlessly and loving yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During my Near Death Experience, I knew I had a reason to come back. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was initially but I knew I didn&rsquo;t have to figure it out or chase it; it would unfold before me. I also knew it would involve reaching a lot of people but I had no idea how, what, where, or why it would happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But I do have a burning drive to tell my story because it was such a revelation to me. I&rsquo;d watched my cancer heal and I wanted people to know about it. So I blogged about what I&rsquo;d been through on the internet and one day I got an email from a Hay House author, Wayne W. Dyer, telling me they wanted to publish my story. That&rsquo;s how my book Dying To Be Me came into existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I would like to have an effect on how cancer as a disease is viewed. I&rsquo;d like help change the way people look at cancer and remove the fear. I don&rsquo;t believe that the cure lies in medicine; scientists are only studying the symptoms and creating drugs to mask them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cases like mine are a disease of the mind and the soul, not the body. The physical manifestation of disease is merely a symptom of something much deeper. I would like to help people love this life and see it for the gift it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>To buy Anita&rsquo;s book, Dying To Be&nbsp;Me, send an email to hariharan.v@ hayhouse.co.in and raj.lakshmi@ hayhouse.co.in.

(88, 'Islam and Aromatherapy', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>A pioneer of aromatherapy was Islam&rsquo;s own father of medicine, Abu Ali Al-Hussain Ibn Sina aka Avicenna. Samar Khan explains Ibn Sina&rsquo;s view of the healing powers of oils and scent.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever wonder where Dubai&rsquo;s chain of Bin Sina pharmacies got its name? Abu Ali Al-Hussain Ibn Sina was&nbsp;the Arabian father of Medicine from Islam&rsquo;s Golden Era around 1000 AD. In the west he was known as Avicenna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered the inventor of distillation, Persian-born Ibn Sina refined traditional distillation processes and invented a<br />\r\npipe that used steam to distill plants and produce true essential oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Middle Ages, the use of plants for medicinal oils and fragrances was commonplace across the world but as the Dark Ages drew a shadow over Europe, their use became controlled by the church. It was thanks to Arabia and Ibn Sina that the herbal traditions of the ancient world were kept alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A prolific scholar of international fame, Ibn Sina wrote more than 200 books including the five volume Canon of Medicine, which was studied in Europe&nbsp;from the 12th to the 17th centuries and contained all medical knowledge of the time. Another of his books was on cardiac drugs and he was one of the first people in antiquity to point out the role of emotions in health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCIENCE OF SCENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a science, aromatherapy got its name from French doctor Rene Gattefosse<br />\r\nwho, in the early 1900s, studied the specific healing properties of the complex constituents of essential oils, which are<br />\r\nthe key to their therapeutic activities. According to Dr Kristie Burns of The Avicenna Institute, an online institute in the United States: &ldquo;This is one of the main reasons why synthetic compounds do not have the same effect. There are now 30,000 known chemical compounds identified in essential oils such as aldehydes, phenols, ketones, esters and monoterpenes. It is important to make sure one is using the&nbsp;purest form of essential oils in order to receive maximum benefit from them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Islam, the healing power of scents, essential oils and traditional oils as a&nbsp;way to correct imbalances that are the source of disease is widely accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The understanding of these essential oil remedies and the methods of extracting essential oils from plants have been passed down to the present time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRAYER, WIVES AND SCENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings Be Upon Him) said, &ldquo;There are three things of this world I have been made to prefer &ndash; prayer, wives and scents.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Burns states that: &ldquo;Many Muslims know this saying yet many fail to realise that scents were used in the time of the Prophet, not just for pleasuring the senses but to achieve, indicate and maintain spiritual states.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prophet&rsquo;s wife Aisha, who recorded&nbsp;the majority of his sayings and actions,&nbsp;wrote: &ldquo;Whenever the Prophet took the bath&nbsp;of purification, he asked for the Hilab or&nbsp;some other scent. He used to take it in his&nbsp;hand, rub it first over the right side of his&nbsp;head and then over the left and then rub the&nbsp;middle of his head with both hands.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only was this calming but it would &nbsp;also put him in a state of cleanliness where all his senses were channeled towards reaching a state of perfect connection with God in his prayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Muslims use generous amounts of rosewater to fragrance mosques and other holy places. In emulation of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), many have adopted his daily rituals in order to enhance their physical and spiritual selves. The idea being that if the outward self is pure and clean then the inward reflects the same state. Pure rosewater is used for purification along with juniper, lemon, pine, sage, lavender, cypress and rosemary oils. Most can be found in Dubai in the Deira Spice Souk located between Baniyas Rd, Al- Sabkha Rd and Al-Abra St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO USE ROSEWATER OILS IN DAILY LIFE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avicenna used oils for daily healing and preventative care. One such oil is rosewater but make sure you are using pure rose water and not the rose essence. Pure rose water is derived from actual rose petals and but rose essence may just be water scented with rose and may have added chemicals added. Here are some examples of using it in daily life:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mood: Love is the metaphysical emotion behind rosewater. A spiritually healing plant, it is good for the heart chakra. Put a few drops into the bath, use in a diffuser or burn as incense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinal: Rosewater oil has anti-septic, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anti-aging: A good skin toner, rosewater oil prevents wrinkles from forming and is a great fragrance for the body and hair. It hydrates dry skin as a natural moisturiser and Cleopatra is said to have often bathed in it (what isn&rsquo;t that woman said to have bathed in?!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutritional: The syrup of rosewater can be added to water or milk as it has beneficial nutrients like flavanoids, antioxidants, tannins and essential vitamins like A, C, D, E and B3. It is also a mild sedative and an anti-depressant. It can help enhance moods, relieve nervous tension, improve skin texture and calm the mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SAMAR KHAN is a student of The Avicenna Institute and a consultant of Naturopathic Medicine.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n', 'aromatherapy1.jpg', '2019-07-27 07:33:59'),
(89, 'I ate my own placenta', 'body', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Yoga teacher and new mother Cheryl Parsons delves into the world of the afterbirth. From capsules and tinctures to raw placenta smoothies, find out why more and more women are choosing to use this amazing organ postpartum&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly dinner party conversation. While I did not whip up a placenta korma, I did&nbsp;effectively ingest my afterbirth in the form of capsules, after the birth of my first baby over six months ago. Now, I&rsquo;m no tree hugging, tie-dye wearing hippie type, but when I heard about using the placenta postpartum during my pre-natal yoga teacher training, I knew it would one day become part of my birth plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months into my pregnancy I told my husband of my plans to get my placenta encapsulated &ndash; dried out, ground down and popped into pill form. Well accustomed to my sometimes weird and wonderful &lsquo;yogic&rsquo; ideas, he was surprisingly&nbsp;understanding: &ldquo;Well, it makes sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, after all, we are one of the very few mammals on this earth that do not eat the placenta&hellip; just don&rsquo;t expect me to be trying any.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My intention is certainly not to&nbsp;put you off your cornflakes, but to show you just what an amazing organ the placenta is. For nine months it nurtures and protects a developing foetus, joining mother to baby via&nbsp;the vital umbilical cord. It floods a baby&rsquo;s body with blood, oxygen and nutrients, while secreting hormones to support a healthy pregnancy. However, when baby has finally arrived, for the most part in the Western world, the cord to its life support &lsquo;machine&rsquo; is quickly severed even while it is still pumping, and the placenta is tossed away as medical waste. Robin Lims&nbsp;in his book,&nbsp;<em>Placenta &ndash; The forgotten Chakra</em>, calls it the &ldquo;heroine of gestation&rdquo; and a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; that should be treated with respect, asking the question: &ldquo;How did the placenta, central to our survival and future well- being, lose its significance and come to be considered garbage?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed in many cultures and religions, the placenta is regarded as highly sacred. Many Muslims bury the placenta under the Islamic belief that it&nbsp;is part of the human body. Eating the placenta or &lsquo;placentophagia&rsquo; has been a common practice for centuries in China, where it is thought to increase milk supply and have anti-ageing properties. In some African nations, the placenta is wrapped and buried under a tree, while in Indonesia it is considered a baby&rsquo;s twin and guardian and must be buried in accordance with sacred traditions. In the animal world, many mammals eat the placenta to speed postpartum recovery and stem blood loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I researched placenta use in Dubai prior to my birth I came across Elizabeth Bain, one of the few women in the UAE who carry out this delicate work. &ldquo;I was always inspired by this lost tradition that was seemingly handed down from women to women within their villages and tribes,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Elizabeth. &ldquo;Yet it wasn&rsquo;t until I trained as a birth doula (birth support partner) that I noticed again how many women were tired, hormonal,&nbsp;depressed, lacked energy and very anxious in the postnatal period. It was then I began to consider what would be of benefit to them to take in a natural, holistic form.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After seeing midwives and doulas offering encapsulation, smoothies&nbsp;and tinctures as a means of natural healing, I began to extensively research the history and benefits. At the same time a doula client who had suffered from severe depression asked me to encapsulate her placenta,&rdquo; Elizabeth continued. &ldquo;She was amazed (and&nbsp;so was I) at how good she felt, how balanced she felt after the birth, how she never felt tired and did not need any medication.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth went on to set up her own services here in Dubai, Placenta Passions, after undergoing extensive training with Full Circle Placenta Encapsulation. The training is meticulous, covering how to prepare the placenta to a very high standard, along with a certification for food hygiene and working with blood-borne viruses. Besides offering the placenta in capsule form, she also makes raw placenta smoothies, something that she says is surprisingly popular in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of women have a placenta smoothie that I make and then take to them in the hospital within a couple of hours of the birth. The rest&nbsp;of their placenta is then made into capsules and a tincture and I also offer placenta prints and cord keepsakes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest feed back I receive&nbsp;is about energy levels, no matter if&nbsp;it is their first baby or their fifth, all&nbsp;my clients have reported a feeling of more energy, better or increased milk supply, quicker healing and surprisingly less hair fall,&rdquo; comments Elizabeth. &ldquo;Other major benefits of consuming the placenta can include guarding against postnatal depression, speeding postpartum recovery, decreasing after- pains and replenishing iron levels, as&nbsp;well as re-balancing hormones such as oxytocin and CRH, which is a natural stress reliever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Childbirth takes so much out of your body, depleting it of essential nutrients as well as creating a massive upheaval to hormonal levels. Personally, this was my first birth and while I have nothing to compare it to,&nbsp;taking my placenta pills did give me the peace of mind that I was giving something back to myself. Although nothing can quite prepare you for the challenges of being a parent, it also helped me to feel I was getting the best, healthy start. While you may not remain convinced, I hope this given you some food for thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits of ingesting the placenta are said to include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Increase milk supply and maternalenergy<br />\r\n&bull; Facilitate an easier postpartum recovery<br />\r\n&bull; Replenish depleted iron levels and VitaminB6<br />\r\n&bull; Contains body&rsquo;s natural hormones<br />\r\n&bull; Balances the system post-birth<br />\r\n&bull; Helps uterus return to pre-pregnancy state more quickly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Inka Resch gave birth to first son, Kai, in July&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had heard that the placenta is a precious resource and was thrilled to learn that it could actually be encapsulated. Easing away from the hormone high of pregnancy and birth rather than having<br />\r\nit just drop off sounded like a smart thing to do. I have to say that my post-birth experience was amazing. I was not tired despite the utter lack of sleep and I felt so happy for weeks and weeks afterwards. I don&rsquo;t know if I can attribute it completely to the placenta capsules, as I have nothing to compare it to, but I have heard from others who have experienced post-birth both with and without them and they noticed a huge difference in mood and energy levels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CHERYL PARSONS is a 500 hour + Yoga Alliance certified instructor</strong></em><br />\r\n<em><strong>and has been teaching Vinyasa and Hatha Flow at Zen Yoga for nearly five years.

Katrina Valente is your guide to naturally loving the skin you&rsquo;re in. This issue, what to do when you&rsquo;re an ethical eco-warrior but who doesn&rsquo;t plan to grow old gracefully.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q.<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;Help! Katrina, I&rsquo;m torn. I want to use ethical and environmentally-friendly products but I have to admit, I also want to wage total war on&nbsp;wrinkles&hellip; when it comes to anti-aging, are organic and natural face products really as effective as the hardcore scientifically tested ones stuffed with chemicals?</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wendy R. Palm Jumeirah</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Dear Wendy,<br />\r\nAh yes, the ethical dilemma of&nbsp;the modern woman! Saving the planet versus fighting off the signs of aging.&nbsp;Each woman needs to strike her own balance. The truth is that, although some organic&nbsp;products are powerful, to get the optimum anti-aging effects from a skincare range, you need to use the &lsquo;hardcore&rsquo; clinical products&nbsp;as they have the most active ingredients for reversing the symptoms of the aging process. I must stress though that I only recommend professional skincare products as they contain the big guns in the anti-aging arsenal, such as Vitamin C and A and alpha lipoic acid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My big secret for the general public is that anything you buy over the counter has a two layer penetration which makes the&nbsp;results superficial and short-lived. A professional product will penetrate to the&nbsp;fourth or fifth layer of the skin where all the collagen and elastin is produced, thus speeding up the regeneration process and giving much longer-lasting results. Also, professional products are not that different in price because with over-the-counter products, you&rsquo;re paying mostly for the mammoth marketing campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter what they tell you&nbsp;is in the product, what&rsquo;s important is the percentage of active ingredients and in an over-the-counter product there is not enough to make a difference. You only get enough active ingredients in a professional product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, organic products can also be very powerful, in particular essential oils. These penetrate to the deeper layers of the skin and also work on the emotional body. Essential oils are best used at night under your night cream as a serum. Oils such as sandalwood, rose, geranium, lavender and jasmine give great results in the war against aging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using a mix of organic and chemical&nbsp;is an option but you need to experiment with what&rsquo;s best suited to your specific skin type. Also, you should change your skin care routine four times a year in line with the change in weather. If you use the same skincare products for too long, the skin becomes accustomed to the products and slows down regeneration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DO TRY THIS AT HOME &ndash; DIY EXFOLIATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great home beauty tip for&nbsp;exfoliating the face and body is to&nbsp;use sea salt with olive or almond&nbsp;oil. Take a handful of sea salt and&nbsp;cover it with the oil to make a paste. Rub over dry skin before&nbsp;you shower or, for a gentler&nbsp;exfoliation, use on wet skin after&nbsp;you shower then rinse again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exfoliate once a week in order to allow proper penetration of your skin products. The sea salt also removes negative energy<br />\r\nin your aura leaving you feeling invigorated and refreshed. For extra softness and moisturising, add a few drops of an essential oil like rose, sandalwood&nbsp;or lavender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEST ORGANIC PRODUCTS FOR ANTI-AG1ING</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eminence Organics,&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Naseberry Treatment&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cream, AED 275</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rich, thick and has a Botox effect to tighten the skin thanks to three per cent glycolic acid from the Naseberry fruit.

Words by Hayley Mac</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked to write this article about my favourite super foods, my first thought was, &ldquo;Oh thats easy&rdquo;&hellip; er, wrong! I hold food in such high regard that choosing just six is tough but I have divided a few of them into two categories: Local organic super food staples and imported speciality&nbsp;super foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know not everyone has the extra money to buy expensive super foods so I&rsquo;ve cut my list in half to show you that it is possible to get super foods into your diet, no matter your budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, in no particular order&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LOCAL ORGANIC SUPER FOOD STAPLES:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Garlic: Part of the onion family, onion promotes movement. Great for circulation and sweating, (the aroma will help to repel mosquitos and fleas) it helps to assist the elimination of toxins and some metals such as lead. Helps to fight colds, flu infections. You can also apply Garlic topically, mash and mix with honey and apply to cuts &amp; sore.. or brew a garlic tea and use this as an ointment. Magic!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know? Nearly 30 studies have shown garlic has cancer-preventative effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Ginger &ndash; A ginger shot a day keeps the anti-histamine pills at bay! Juice a chunk&nbsp;with an apple and down it every morning. Great for asthmatics or if you have a cold or flu. Clears congestion and mucous. Ginger is also amazing for digestion, sickness, its a powerful anti-inflammatory so a must for anyone suffering with arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know? Ginger has blood-thinning qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Coconuts &ndash; Living in the desert, these should be part of your daily diet. The water is high in potassium, an important electrolyte, so it is an excellent hydrator. Coconut water composition is similar to hemoglobin (our blood) making it a great blood cleanser. If you are using an oil to cook, coconut oil is the most stable at &nbsp;high&nbsp;temperatures, so the safest to cook with. It is also a healing oil to use topically, great to help banish bad bacteria from your skin, a great moisturiser for your whole body and your hair. I also rub it into my gums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know? Coconut water composition is similar to hemoglobin (our blood) making it a great blood cleanser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMPORTED SPECIALITY SUPER FOODS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Maca is a root vegetable that looks a bit like a turnip. Grown at high altitudes in the Andes, it&rsquo;s an adaptogenic food, which means it helps your body cope with stress. It also helps balance hormones, improve fertility, libido, strength and stamina.<br />\r\nDid you know? Did you know: Maca has much higher level of calcium than milk and is a complete protein providing all<br />\r\nthe essential amino acids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Cacao &ndash; Raw cacao is one of the best sources of magnesium of any known food. Magnesium helps to circulate oxygen, blood and nutrients around your body, helps your heart and brain to stay healthy, gives you healthy bones and muscles, eases PMS, headaches, migraines&hellip; and so on. Cacao is also high in zinc and iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know? Raw cacao is the base for chocolate but it loses its super food potency when heated or mixed with sugar and dairy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Goji Berries &ndash; How many berries do you know that have all eight essential amino acids and 18 in total? They are almost a complete food with 500 times the vitamin&nbsp;C of an orange. These mega berries are held in high regard in Chinese medicine, a great jing energy food, increasing the energy of your kidneys and adrenals. Like Maca, goji berries are an adaptogenic food, increasing the strength and stamina throughout your whole system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know? Goji berries have antioxidant levels 10 times more than blueberries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Hayley Mac is founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/six-healing-super-foods/www.besupernatural.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.besupernatural.com</a>, a UAE-based online shop for raw, vegan, organic, ethical foodstuffs and groceries.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n', 'cacao-1024x930.jpg', '2019-07-27 07:37:41'),
(94, 'How To Get The Universe On Your Side', 'mind', 'mind', '', '', '', '<p>WORDS BY ELYSE SANTILLI</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Does life sometimes feel really hard? Like there is so much to do and so little time? Like you have to strive and struggle to make things happen?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your life does not have to feel this way. You are not in this life on your own. But first, let me tell you about my week. I received:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Money found on the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; A free glass of wine at a restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Free printing at the stationary store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; A complimentary $97 ticket to a workshop on flow next weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; A psychological personality assessment worth around $300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The seat I wanted on the bus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;That&rsquo;s just what I can remember off the top of my head.&nbsp; The point is not to show off: Oh look how amazing my life is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The point is that you can experience this kind of synchronicity and support from life too. We live in a world where the ruling paradigm teaches us we are separate, small and capable of very little. We are taught that we must work really hard and ignore our true dreams because they are bound to be out of reach. This is not how life is supposed to be!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know those things you really want deep down in your heart but you are scared to even think about them anymore because it hurts so much because you don&rsquo;t believe you can have them? You are born to have them! Your true soul desires are yours for a reason. They come from your higher self. However, in order to get where you want to go, you might want to consider getting some support from life. In truth, the power or divine intelligence that creates galaxies and stars and oceans and flowers and babies can help us to create our dreams too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know where to begin, here are 5 simple ways to get the Universe on your side:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.CHANGE YOUR BELIEFS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beliefs are not truths. They are just thoughts you have thought over and over again. So empower yourself by choosing beliefs that serve you. Believe you are worthy of love, abundance, success, travel or whatever it is you desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: I used to believe that I was unworthy of dating an amazing guy, so my life reflected this belief; I dated all the wrong men. When I dug up this limiting belief from my mind garden and planted seeds of self-love and self-worth, suddenly I found my love life thriving! A few months later I met my dream partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/caption-1-picedit-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:237px; width:356px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. TUNE INTO THE FEELING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want a fulfilling career? Feel what that would feel like, now. Want to meet your soulmate? Find ways to feel love in your life now, now! The Universe does&nbsp;not respond to what you want. It responds to who you are being. So if you feel like you already have your desire, it comes right to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: I love freedom so I often tune into this feeling by imagining being in new places. I visualise and feel grateful for travel and adventure. From doing this, out of the blue my friend invited me on an all-expenses-paid trip to a luxury resort; I was given a business class upgrade on another trip; and I actually ended up in five different countries last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;FOLLOW YOUR HEART</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a strong yearning for a career change, love, new friendships or travel, it has been given to you for a reason. Your desires are impulses from life itself. Desire is the thread that connects you to the will of your higher self. Trust in whatever brings you joy. It will lead you to your destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: I have always been interested in writing, self-help and coaching. When I decided to change careers after being a lawyer, my rational mind told me that I was nuts. Thankfully I trusted in my heart and I now get to do work that I love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/follow-your-heart-450x352.jpg\" style=\"height:352px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;DO NOT BASE YOUR DREAMS ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your current circumstances are simply a reflection of what you were thinking and believing and feeling last week or last month or last year. They are old news. If you want something new, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your circumstances look like. Begin focusing on what you do want and reality will literally shift around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: When I needed to move house, the rental market in my city was really expensive &ndash; it was one of the top 5 most expensive cities in the world! According to &ldquo;reality&rdquo; I could not afford to rent a nice apartment on my own. However, instead of believing in this circumstance, I simply imagined living in an amazing apartment and feeling happy there. A few weeks later I found a gorgeous apartment which was priced way below anything similar on the market. The property inspection was at an odd time of day so very few people attended and I was easily able to win the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;BUILD A STRONGER CONNECTION WITH YOUR SOUL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your soul or spirit or higher self (the part of you which is bigger than your body) has the knowledge and answers and guidance you seek. But you have to invite it to help you out. Begin to ask for guidance and support to lead you where you want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: This year I want to learn more about being a vessel or channel for love. So I prayed for guidance from my soul self. Out of the blue my friend invited me to a weekend workshop on this exact topic. She just so happened to have a spare ticket. The workshop blew my mind and gave me the exact answers I sought. I hope this serves as a reminder that the Universe has your back and you are worthy of your dreams and desires my friend.</p>\r\n', 'lpovely_picedit-1-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-28 05:00:43'),
(95, 'Master the Law of Attraction', 'mind', 'mind', '', '', '', '<p><strong>WORDS BY ZAKARIYA ADEEL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Call it positive thinking, cosmic ordering or the Secret, the law of attraction seems to be everywhere. But what is it?&nbsp; The law of attraction is the notion that one attracts to themselves that which they keep in the forefront of their minds; if your thoughts are mostly positive, then you will get positive results, if it&rsquo;s negative, then you can expect its physical equivalent. It&rsquo;s like these universal creations are sat in a pot, waiting to be experienced by you, bit by bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But isn&rsquo;t that just Fate?</strong><br />\r\nYes and no. There are a handful of experiences that are decided upon before birth, such as ones parents which gives us all the individual trajectory we have chosen for this particular incarnation, however, the majority of life experiences are created as we go along using the law of attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I use The Law of Attraction?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people are creating by default because they are unaware of this law. So they observe &ldquo;what is&rdquo; and continue to get more of &ldquo;what is&rdquo; because that is what they have in the forefront of their minds. However, for those who want to be conscious creators, they mustlearn keep in mind those experiences that they want to create as if they already exist and soon enough, the mental image is projected as a physical manifestation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the Tarot reading help?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Psychic and Astrologer, I use my abilities to peek into that universal pot before its been experienced by my clients and let them know what is on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personality Archetypes &ndash; Combined Astrology</strong><br />\r\nThe date of birth of the client and time, if available, tells me which archetypal personality I have before me using combined astrology methods of Chinese and Western astrology. See my books, Secrets of the Combined Astrology and The Combined Astrology Series for the 144 individual combined astrology personality books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Situational Archetypes</strong><br />\r\nLaying out the tarot cards, I am given the archetypal situations that the client has experienced, is currently experiencing and what is in that universal pot, waiting to come to them in the short term and long term future. If what&rsquo;s coming is positive, then no adjustments are needed. However, if they are negative experiences that the client wants to avoid and turn into something positive, then some energy shifting is necessary around those specific topics. If someone wants to attract something specific into their lives, then some guided energy shifting can be recommended for that also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I shift my energy?</strong><br />\r\nThere are a variety of ways; my favorite is meditation. Meditation is my medication of choice. I give the client specific meditations to suit their situation and I recommend that they listen to them every night for 30 days. In addition, positive affirmations, visualizations, appreciation and belief bulldozing also help. See below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Affirmations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affirmations are statements that assert that you already have or already are something that you are aspiring to. They can be said or written as long as they are repeated frequently and with feeling with the ultimate aim of convincing yourself that they are true. Once you do, the universal power makes them true with little effort. Affirmations are helpful because they obliterate limiting beliefs that may be preventing your dream from manifesting. For example, I am worthy of my dream car and I deserve to have the best of everything in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visualization</strong><br />\r\nVisualizations are visual affirmations. You imagine yourself amidst the perfect circumstances or you imagine the perfect circumstances around you. Believe you already have that promotion or walk into the garage and imagine the car of your dreams is there. Allow these visualizations to evoke feelings of excitement within you. The more often you do them, the faster your dream will come to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Appreciation</strong><br />\r\nHaving an attitude of gratitude pays dividends because you are always in a positive frame of mind. The feeling you get when you are grateful for something is the same feeling you have when you are full of love, so when you are in a state of appreciation, you are attracting love towards you at all times. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Belief Bulldozing</strong><br />\r\nBelief bulldozing is a good technique for those who are very rationally minded as it uses logic to remove mental blocks that may be preventing your desired manifestations. They can be written or verbalized, whatever is more useful to you. You start by stating the current limiting belief as yourself and you play devils advocate as the Universe disassembling the legitimacy of your limiting belief reducing its influence until it disappears altogether.<br />\r\n<strong>For example:</strong><br />\r\nCLIENT: I will never earn more than<br />\r\n&pound;30,000<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Why not?<br />\r\nCLIENT: Because I am already at the top of<br />\r\nmy pay bracket and this is all I&rsquo;m trained<br />\r\nto do?<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Is that really true?<br />\r\nCLIENT: It&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve ever done and I&rsquo;m in the<br />\r\nbest paying company for what we do so yes<br />\r\nit&rsquo;s true.<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: So the skills you have cannot be<br />\r\ntransferred to another occupation?<br />\r\nCLIENT: Not really?<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Not really?<br />\r\nCLIENT: Well they could but it would mean<br />\r\ndropping a level in salary initially and then I<br />\r\nwould have to work my way up again but that<br />\r\nmight take years.<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Or you could spend those same<br />\r\nyears working in your current job earning<br />\r\n&pound;26,000 a year.<br />\r\nCLIENT: I can&rsquo;t change job now I&rsquo;m too old.<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Then you are choosing your<br />\r\ncircumstances.<br />\r\nCLIENT: I have responsibilities. What<br />\r\ndo you want me to do? Put myself into<br />\r\nuncertainty?<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: If that&rsquo;s what it takes to get<br />\r\nwhat you want, are you prepared to take the<br />\r\nchance?<br />\r\nCLIENT: I guess so.<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Then you know what to do?<br />\r\nCLIENT: But what if I fail?<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: There is no such thing as failure<br />\r\nthere are only obstacles that will need to be overcome. If you do what it takes, you cannot possibly fail. Believe in yourself.<br />\r\nCLIENT: Okay. Wish me luck.<br />\r\nUNIVERSE: Good luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are aware of it or not, the law of attraction is always at work and you are constantly attracting into your life the essence of the vibration your thoughts and feelings emit. Remember to focus your energy on what you do want instead of what you do not want. Commit to living in a world of your own creation and commit to taking action to create it when the opportunity presents itself. When you feel good, the law is working in your favor, when you feel bad, you know some energy-shifting is in order.</p>\r\n', 'zak-1edit-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-28 05:01:24'),

Tolle</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 10 years ago the word spread in Buenos Aires that a renowned master from India would come to town. The purpose of his visit was to teach people how to&hellip; breathe! I still remember how ridiculous and funny the concept sounded to me: &ldquo;How can somebody teach me how to breathe? I surely know how to do that, I&rsquo;ve been practicing continuously since birth!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With time and study, I came to understand the invisible and powerful role breath has if we are to lead empowered, conscious, stress free lives. According to Dan Brul&eacute;, an international Breathwork Master whom I was fortunate enough to meet, 70% of the toxins in our body are released through breathing. Yes, this means that taking long, deep breaths as often as we can is more detoxing than any green smoothie! Taking long deep breaths not only helps us detox physically, but also brings clarity of mind, releases anxiety, helps fight depression and improves our capacity to make conscious decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way we breath determines the way our mind and body feels. Shallow breaths are a sign of anxiety and puts our body in a fight or flight mode. Taking deep breaths when we find ourselves in such situations has the power to bring ourselves back to a balanced, relaxed state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ancient science of yoga has known and taught this for millennia: the air we breath is our main life force energy (prana) and through controlling and extending our breath, we are controlling and extending our lives. The longer our breathe is, the longer is our lifespan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To consciously make an effort to bring our awareness back to the gift of each breath should be regarded as the most important daily practice if we are serious about increasing our spiritual awareness and wellbeing. Conscious long breaths not only keeps us young, stress free and balanced but also brings us in sync with the present moment, the only real space where reality happens, the space where gratitude for being alive is the secret power that fuels our every thought and action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>instagram.com/pazporelmundo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.pazporelmundo.com</p>\r\n', 'Yoga-Dubai-Maria-Paz-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 05:52:51'),

Aren&rsquo;t we all here, now, in the present? Well yes, beautiful soul, but for so many of us, we are only 10% here. We are really living in our minds. We exist from day-to-day in a dream-like state where we&rsquo;re not really connected to the world around us, nor centered in our own body or being. Instead, we&rsquo;re preoccupied with memories of the past, churning thoughts and worries about the future, and judgments and reactions to the few things we do see. Or perhaps we are lost in our smartphones and television sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re literally missing out on most our own lives, which leaves us feeling shallow, empty and deeply unsettled.

It&rsquo;s like someone has turned up the colour setting on the world to transform it from dull greys into an incredible vibrant rainbow. You rarely feel stressed out or overwhelmed, because you know you can slow down time and calm yourself down simply by becoming more present. You suddenly gain more control over your thoughts and emotions &ndash; you realise that you are the ruler of your mind, not the other way around.&nbsp; This realisation leads to a growing sense of centeredness, joy, love and inner peace. You can then anchor in this inner peace all throughout the day, even when your external life becomes rough and choppy like the surface of the ocean on a windy day. So how do you become more present?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>EAT MINDFULLY</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you scoff down your meal on autopilot while distracted by the television, computer or constant conversation, you miss out on the delicious taste and smell of your food. You&rsquo;re also less likely to feel satisfied and nourished, as you &lsquo;missed out&rsquo; on the fact that you ate. It can be helpful to remember this phrase: When you eat, eat. When you drink, drink. In other words, don&rsquo;t attempt to do fifty other things when you sit down to a meal, coffee or green juice. Simply focus all of your attention on what is in front of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. &nbsp;WALK MINDFULLY &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a beautiful tip from spiritual leader Thich Nhat Hanh and &lsquo;walk as if you are kissing the earth with your feet&rsquo;. In others words, when you are out and about, pay attention occasionally to the movement of your body and your surroundings. Notice as your feet connect with and leave the ground. Feel your muscles moving and supporting you. Observe what is going on around you &ndash; the sights, sounds and life unfolding. You may be amazed to find a whole new world you hadn&rsquo;t even noticed before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;3. OBSERVE YOUR BREATHING &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Echkart Tolle once said, a single breath in and out is a meditation. Your breathing occurs naturally and rhythmically. When you pay attention to it, it takes you out of your mind and into your body. You momentarily free yourself from your churning thoughts, worries and fears, and you remind yourself of who you really are &ndash; your inner spirit, not your thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_89223232EDIT-450x418.jpg\" style=\"height:312px; width:335px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>4. CONNECT W</strong><strong>ITH&nbsp;YOUR SENSES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your senses &ndash; touch, smell, taste, sound and sight &ndash; are your gateway into the present moment. But when you are lost in &nbsp;thought, you don&rsquo;t experience what your senses are picking up. Pause to soak up the beautiful aroma of your coffee. The salty ocean air. The beauty and diversity of flowers in your neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mouth-watering waft of wood-fire pizza coming from your local Italian restaurant as you pass it. &nbsp;Notice how your clothing feels against your body. The soft clean bed sheets on your skin in the &nbsp;morning. The comforting warmth of your lover&rsquo;s kiss. The grass under your feet. The sensation of water and suds on your hands as you do the washing up. Put love and attention into the simple tasks of your day, and you will be amazed how much joy and peace they can bring you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;5. LISTEN WHOLEHEARTEDLY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us never truly listen to people when they are speaking to us, because we&rsquo;re too busy planning what to say next, judging what they are saying, or getting lost in daydreams altogether. Next time you&rsquo;re in a conversation, make it your goal to fully listen to what the other person is saying to you, without getting lost in your thoughts. Trust that you will intuitvely know the right thing to say next when it&rsquo;s your turn to speak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. PAUSE BETWEEN ACTION</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause and listen to the sound of the phone ringing before answering it. Pause and feel the weight of your body in your chair before beginning your work for the day. Pause and feel the door handle of your home before you open it at the end of the day. Putting mini pauses between actions in your day can ground you in your inner being, clear your mind, and provide you with fresh energy for the new task ahead. Think of it like putting energetic bookends at the start and end of each activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. GET LOST IN THE FLOW OF DOING THINGS YOU LOVE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have certain activities we love doing &ndash; they connect us with our inner spirit and bring us fully alive. For you it could be cooking, dancing, singing, gardening, writing, painting, bushwalking, swimming or building Ikea furniture. We love doing these things so much that we often lose ourselves in them. That is, we lose our smaller self &ndash; our churning thoughts and worries &ndash; because we are pouring all of our love and &nbsp;attention into the present moment. Incorporate more flow activities in your weekly routine, and your happiness will skyrocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_433174789-2EDIT-450x300.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; width:450px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. MEDITATE DAILY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no getting around it &ndash; meditation has huge benefits and increases your levels of energy, happiness, inspiration and inner peace. It doesn&rsquo;t have to take long. Even ten &nbsp;minutes a day can have a positive impact on your life. It will also strengthen your mindfulness muscles, so you&rsquo;ll find it much easier to become present throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. TRAVEL OR MIX UP YOUR ROUTINE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s more than one reason you feel amazing on holidays. When you&rsquo;re in a new place, you automatically become more present and mindful &ndash; simply because there are so many new sights, sounds and smells to soak up. Your senses take over for a short while and it frees you from your mind. No travel plans? That&rsquo;s fine. Mix up your routine &ndash; it will have the same effect. Take a different route, stop at a new coffee shop, visit a new place locally or try something you&rsquo;ve done done before like paddle boarding, &nbsp;cooking a new recipe or writing calligraphy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. OBSERVE YOUR THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not your thoughts &ndash; you are the observer of your thoughts. The fact that you can listen to them shows that they are not you. You are something higher and separate. By simply becoming aware of your thoughts and nonjudgmentally observing them as they come and go &ndash; like clouds passing in the sky &ndash; you are being more present. You are not getting caught up in your thoughts and forgetting that they are not you. As you observe, resist the temptation to get carried away by a particular thought down a tunnel &nbsp;into the past or future. Picture your thoughts like trains at the station &ndash; you&rsquo;re on the platform watching them come and go, but you&rsquo;re not going to jump on and go for a ride. &nbsp;I hope that helps, beautiful soul. I&rsquo;ll leave you with one of my favourite quotes about becoming more present and mindful: When did life become a race? If we can catch our &nbsp;breath, take a look around and begin to see our life with a renewed sense of appreciation, then the journey itself takes on rich colour and depth, we begin to take in the &nbsp;scenery and all the details. ~ The Gyalwang Drukpa.</p>\r\n', 'shutterstock_51092698EDIT-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 05:54:07');

(99, 'Eating Mindfully', 'mind', 'body', 'weight-loss', '', '', '<p><em><strong>We all eat every day, and the food we choose can be a powerful influence on our wellbeing, health, energy and mood. How we eat is just as important. Mindful attention to the simple act of eating has the potential to transform your health significantly&nbsp;for the better. Eating mindfully promotes a healthy body weight, more conscious food choices, and healthier digestion. It also ensures optimum absorption of nutrients, optimum energy from what you eat, and increases self-awareness. | WORDS BY PHOEBE BOONKERD</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat slowly, chew food well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one food habit that you should adopt long term, this is the one it should be. Chew each mouthful to a liquid state before you swallow and put your eating utensils down between mouthfuls. This gives your digestive system a chance to communicate to your brain more effectively that you are full and also gives you a chance to listen to that signal, resulting in smaller portion intake.<br />\r\nWe are more likely to overeat when we gulp our food and do not chew. Proper chewing initiates digestive enzyme secretion, and increases the surface area of food, resulting in improved nutrient absorption and digestion. Try eating slowly, chewing each mouthful up to 20-40 times</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hara Hachi Bu to you!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a cultural habit &ndash; Eat until 80 Percent Full &ndash; practiced on the island of Okinawa, Japan, one of the world&rsquo;s most healthiest and long-living population groups. Studies show that those who practice Hara Hachi Bu consume 30% fewer calories than average, or who practice Hara Hachi Bu, actually age more slowly and live longer. This light under-eating at each meal also optimises digestion and reduces common symptoms such as gas, bloating, belching and other discomforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nourish your body with as many high quality foods you can afford or obtain. Your body is the vehicle in which you travel through life, and it deserves the best fuel so it serves you well into the future. The human body needs an abundance of plant foods, mostly vegetables as the dominant food group, supplemented by quality proteins, good fats and a smaller proportion of grains and root vegetables. Eat a rainbow of colour and variety of foods every day. This is the foundational principle of healthy eating and as a general philosophy, and as a lifestyle choice it is the golden rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time your meals well, and always eat breakfast</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to start your day with a healthy breakfast &ndash; make time to savour and enjoy it &ndash; smoothies, juices, organic eggs, wholegrain porridges, grainy bread, avocado,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and fresh or sauteÌed vegetables are all great options. Overall, increasing the volume of vegetable intake in favour of carbohydrate staples (bread, rice, pasta), and maintaining a protein food at each meal supports balanced energy and a healthy body weight. Eat sensible sized portions approximately every 4 hours, allowing a healthy appetite for each meal. 3 meals plus an afternoon snack is a pattern that suits most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make sure there is a &lsquo;fast&rsquo; to break!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, make sure that the time between dinner and breakfast is a 12-hour fast. Digestion slows down at night, and we need fuel for the day. This simple fact means that the body is designed for a healthy, good-sized breakfast before 9am, a substantial lunch before 1pm, and a light dinner that finishes by 8pm for the body to renew, detoxify and rest as we sleep. It&rsquo;s best to stop eating 3 hours before sleeping. If your schedule is far away from this ideal, do what you can to gradually shift it. If you must eat late, vegetable soup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is recommended, as it is easy to digest, filling and less likely to burden your system, which promotes weight gain and &lsquo;morning fog&rsquo;. If you aren&rsquo;t hungry for breakfast, you probably ate too much, too late the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat to live, rather than live to eat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy eating can be applied to what the Taoist philosophy calls &lsquo;going in two directions at once&rsquo;. This means, in one direction, focus on eating healthy food, get organised, sort out how you can logistically eat healthily, who is preparing it, to what recipes, and what you plan to eat, and then, and in the other direction, let food go a little, don&rsquo;t make it the main focus of your life. Eat mindfully in the act itself, and then get on with your daily tasks, forget about food for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avoid poor combinations or foods that burden your body</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have digestive problems, this is especially important, and you may get a lot of insight from a food and symptom diary. Fruits should be eaten alone, or before meals, never after, as this compromises digestion and encourages gas. Avoid drinking a lot of fluid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>with your meals as this also compromises digestion. Take notice the effects of the foods you eat, and avoid foods that you associate with discomfort or excessive fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food intolerance testing is very useful for ascertaining individual sensitivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about cravings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugar and carb cravings are a symptom of poor nutrition and fatigue. The intensity of cravings can be used as a barometer of how stressed, fatigued or poorly nourished you are. A more balanced eating plan can be of great assistance in preventing this. Sleep, emotional issues and stress are also essential to address and have a direct effect on cravings, eating patterns, and body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much is enough?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have slightly different needs in terms of portion sizes, but it is safe to say that many of us overeat routinely, which makes<br />\r\nus lose our sense of how much we should actually eat. To re-connect with this, one of the best techniques is to eat slowly. Another helpful technique is to use your own hand as a guide. This gives a good estimate, based on your body size:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PER MEAL:<br />\r\nProtein foods: the size and thickness of your own palm, or a handful of non-animal proteins such as beans and tofu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-starchy vegetables: 2-3 large handfuls (2 cooked, 3 raw)<br />\r\nCarb staples: as much as could t in your own cupped hand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fats: no more than your first three fingers- size portion of nuts or seeds or 1 tablespoon of cold pressed oil per meal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You are what you eat!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a plain fact! Eat lots of starch and simple sugars (bread, pastries, candy, chocolate, alcohol, potatoes, etc.) and you will become overweight (excess sugars in the body are converted into fatty acids which are stored as fat). Eat fried food and not only are you saturating your body, arteries and veins with gunk, but that gunk is in a free radical state. You&rsquo;ve heard of free radicals right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s telling you to avoid</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>by taking anti-oxidants. Well even better, combine our with high heated Trans-fat oils (as in French fries, donuts, fritters, etc.) and you have a recipe for obesity, Diabetes, and chronic disease. YOU NEED to eat fruits and vegetable if you are going to be truly healthy. That&rsquo;s a fact! Learn to immerse yourself in the wonders of the plant kingdom. You&rsquo;ll glow for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat in peace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating in stressful environments, such as over your keyboard, an argument or intense conversation, a TV show, in a mindless haze in the car, or when you are stressed or upset is hard on your digestive function and promotes digestive disturbance, overeating, too much of the wrong foods, guilt, and a bad relationship with food as a crutch for stressful emotions. Eat in a place where you can be calm, with minimal conversation of light topics, if any. Create a feeling of ceremony, with some aesthetically appealing table settings, bowls, and implements. Treat eating as an important act, and a chance to relax 3 times a day. Savour the moment, the environment,<br />\r\nthe company (even your own) and the flavours.</p>\r\n', 'Eating-mindfully-small-702x336.jpg', '2019-08-08 10:33:04'),
(100, 'Visiting Brazilâ€™s John of God', 'mind', 'healing', 'mediumship', '', '', '<p><em>Every year, thousands of people make the trip to a small town in rural Brazil to visit John of God, a man who&rsquo;s said to do miraculous healings. In 2014,&nbsp;<strong>Natasha Tome</strong>&nbsp;was one of those visitors, here she describes the experience.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a small town in central rural Brazil, there lives a man of humble origins who has healed many thousands of&nbsp;people over the last 38 years from the Casa de Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. Now aged 73 (as of 2014), he&rsquo;s been visited by all and sundry, from the poorest in Brazil who travel over 30 hours by bus to see him, to the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Wayne Dwyer and Shirley MacLaine. While it may sound like a fairy tale, Medium Jo&atilde;o Teixeira de Faria, commonly known as Medium Jo&atilde;o, is a full trance medium that incorporates ascended beings of the light into his body for the healing of others. These beings of light were once incarnated as human doctors, surgeons, and healers and have now taken up the task to offer healing on earth during our lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I sit here in the serene and tranquil Casa garden writing this article, I reflect on my healing path and how it has brought me here to this tiny town in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had been exploring energy healing modalities for years while living in Europe, Asia and the Middle East<br />\r\nwhen my path took me to Dubai-based healers Terri Allen and Buddy Abrahams (official Casa guides). They introduced me to a spiritual hospital in the Brazilian town of Abadi&acirc;nia where I could clear myself energetically of old emotions, hurts, anger, grief, resentment, as well as any physical ailments. Many believe that old stuck emotions can manifest into physical ailments and illnesses if left to fester. Something inside of me clicked when Terri explained the Casa to me and Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s work there. I wanted a clean, clear aura! I didn&rsquo;t want to carry emotional baggage with me for the rest of my life. Added to that was an annoying physical injury from a fall I had taken the year earlier. A left foot and right elbow that were stubbornly refusing to heal. I was ready, willing and able to experience my own divine healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MI CASA SU CASA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not necessary to go to the Casa with guides, it is recommended for first timers. I first went in August 2013 with Terri and Buddy as my guides and then on my own in July 2014. My first visit to the Casa healed me of my physical ailments so on the next visit I requested an emotional healing and clearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o is in attendance at the Casa from Wednesday to Friday so I arrived Tuesday afternoon at my Pousada (inn), a peaceful oasis painted in lilac and white, with an inner courtyard garden with fountain and koi pond. The rooms are basic but adequate and you get three meals per day. I nipped over to the Casa bookshop to buy a supply of bottled water blessed by the entities, which greatly assists with your healing. A quiet dinner and early to bed with excited anticipation of the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising early to the sounds of crowing roosters and chirping birds, I joined the many other white-clad people walking to the Casa. The entities request that everyone wear white so that auras are easily seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were easily hundreds of white- clad people milling around waiting to see Medium Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated entity that day. I heard snatches of conversations in English, German, French, Italian and<br />\r\nof course Portuguese. After standing in the translation line to get my requests translated into Portuguese by a Casa volunteer (Medium Jo&atilde;o only speaks Portuguese), we then waited for our respective lines to be called. Lines for first timers, for repeat visitors, for interventions or revisions, every single person would be seen that day with remarkable organisation. There were people there in wheelchairs, on crutches, children, some&nbsp;sitting fervently in prayer, some laughing in the sunshine with friends, but all with a palpable vibe of hope and faith in the divine healing to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAINTS AND SOUP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Casa grounds, painted in sky blue and white as dictated years ago by its patron saint, Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. The grounds include a bookshop where you&rsquo;ll find several books on healing, healing crystals blessed by the entities, statues, photos, and even t-shirts and bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small caf&eacute; sells delicious Brazilian delicacies, fresh coconut water and juices and hot drinks. There are meditation grounds overlooking a beautiful vista of rolling hills and valleys. You feel far removed from the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world of worries and stresses while at the Casa. The soup kitchen at the Casa serves free healing soup to hundreds each day of the Casa operation and not far from there are the crystal bed rooms where you can sign up for 20 minute intervals on these healing chromotherapy beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also several places of prayer throughout, with triangles (the symbol of the Casa; representing faith, love and charity) for loved ones to place requests, pictures and prayers for those unable to travel to the Casa. The Entity will receive all requests from these triangles and bless them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEETING THE MAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my line shuffled forward to Medium Jo&atilde;o sitting on his chair, we passed through the current rooms where volunteers sat for their own healing and also to help hold the energy for Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated Entity. He sat beside several four-foot high crystals emanating light. As I approached him, nervous, my heart in my throat, I remembered the guidance to look in his eyes as my translator spoke to Jo&atilde;o in rapid Portuguese with my requests. Jo&atilde;o took my hand in his soft hand and as I gazed into his eyes (blue that day, for they are known to change according to whichever Entity is incorporated), I felt he was looking inside me, to my soul, with such love and compassion. He gazed at me for mere seconds, which passed in a daze for me, and muttered something in Portuguese to my translator as he guided me by hand past him. Spiritual intervention that afternoon he&nbsp;had prescribed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each person&rsquo;s case is individual and&nbsp;the Entity might ask you to come back later in the day to visit with a different Entity who specialises in your specific issue, or you may be scheduled for a spiritual intervention, a session on the crystal bed, a visit to the sacred waterfall, passiflora herbs, meditation in the current, or whatever the divine deems you require at that moment in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I returned back that afternoon as requested at 2pm and the intervention line was the first one called. We were brought inside to a healing room to sit in meditation with eyes closed and our hands on our hearts or on the location of where you wanted the most healing. Casa volunteers explained that the entities can work on up to nine issues at once, all you had to do as you sat there was mentally ask. We sat quietly for about 45 minutes feeling waves of energy flowing through me and around me. Lost in my thoughts of what I wanted healed, I heard the deep tones of Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s voice in the room blessing us all and then we were escorted out for the briefing. This was my third spiritual intervention so I knew the drill of immediate bed rest for the next 24 hours, no sun, no physical exertion, and other requirements for the next eight days. First timers would have those restrictions for 40 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o often says he can do 60 per cent of the healing work, and the rest is up to the individual so it was very important that we follow the guidelines given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BED REST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I lay in my room at the Pousada during my ordered 24-hour bed rest, I felt energy and pressure flowing and moving into and throughout my body. Through my abdomen, my head, my ears, my arms and legs. While I had requested healing for three specific issues, I felt the work being done throughout my whole body. Drifting in and out of sleep, at times having a good cry, journaling thoughts and emotions I was releasing, after the 24 hours was up, I felt cleaner, lighter, brighter and renewed. I felt like I was glowing from within. Physically I saw that my eyes were brighter, my skin fresher and smoother, and emotionally I felt like all emotions and thoughts that I&rsquo;d been holding onto that were not for my highest good had been pulled out of me and transmuted into nothingness. I was full of life plans and actions steps that I was eager to start on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day I headed early to the Casa to sit in the current room. While we sit there to help hold the energy and vibration for the divine healing work being done on our earthly plane, it is also a time when a phalange of entities work the room and heal those walking through, as well as those sitting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After each current session, I felt amazing. My mood was uplifted, I felt love and compassion for everyone, I didn&rsquo;t judge and I felt benevolence for everyone and everything. I feel like I have had a profound spiritual awakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING &amp; EMOTIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my last night in Abadi&acirc;nia, I spoke with an American woman at my Pousada who had come to Brazil with breast cancer. Diagnosed in September 2013, she did not want surgery nor radiation or chemotherapy. Her medical doctor called her daily advising her to get surgery or she will die. Instead she went to a naturopath who suggested it was an emotional block and perhaps she should go to Brazil to visit Medium Jo&atilde;o at the Casa. Two spiritual interventions later and another one during the night in her room, she told me she physically felt scalpels cutting into her breast, to her lymph node. She felt the pain, the heat, of work being done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many books written about Medium Jo&atilde;o and the successful healings he has orchestrated over the years but nothing can replace the awe of being at the Casa in person, feeling the energy, watching crutches being thrown aside as a person feebly makes their first unaided step, watching crying children immediately fall asleep after sipping blessed water while waiting in the lines, and just feeling the divine love and compassion pouring out of Medium Jo&atilde;o himself. A man who has devoted his life to being a vehicle of healing for others. As he often says, &ldquo;I do not cure anybody. God is the one who cures.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTACTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official website of the Casa<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.joaodedeusabadiania.com/\">www.joaodedeusabadiania.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubai-based Casa guides Terri and Buddy Abrahams<br />\r\nhttp://angelsoflightonline.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br />\r\nNATASHA TOME is an Atlantean Energy Healing practitioner and freelance writer based in Dubai, UAE.<br />\r\nEmail: natasha@whitelotuslight.com</p>\r\n', 'John-of-God-by-Cande-Salles-702x526-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:25:04'),

Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D. Griffiths of the Psychological Wellbeing and Metal Health Research Unit of the UK&rsquo;s Nottingham Trent University report on meditation as medication.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recently, it was practically unheard of that doctors and other front-line health professionals would even consider prescribing their patients&rsquo; meditation rather than medication. However, according to a report by the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mental Health Foundation,&nbsp;</em>72 per cent of general practitioners in the UK now believe that patients can improve their health by practising meditation. The most popular meditation technique to be used in research and healthcare settings is mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is the practice of cultivating a full and open awareness of the present moment. Research has shown that we have a tendency to not be &lsquo;fully present&rsquo; and this can sometimes leave us feeling that life is racing by too fast. If we spend most of our time dwelling on the past and/or trying to rush towards the future, then we miss out on what is happening &lsquo;here and now&rsquo;. Given that the past is history, and the future is fantasy, the present moment is the only place where we can truly experience and appreciate the wonders of life. So how do we introduce mindfulness into our daily lives and make sure that we stay in touch with the present moment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mindfulness explained</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindfulness has been used by Buddhist practitioners for over 2,500 years. Although you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that &lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo; means that we should be &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo;, this doesn&rsquo;t quite capture the essence of mindfulness practice. Being &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo; basically means that there is a lot of mental exertion (as well as a lot of brain noise and chatter). Having a &lsquo;full up&rsquo; mind all of the time can be stressful and tiring and it doesn&rsquo;t leave room for wholesome thoughts to grow and flourish. Mindfulness helps to create space in the mind so that we can observe and nourish our being more fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life is an extraordinarily rare and fragile gift. If we are fortunate, it may last for 100 years. Each and every moment contained within those 100 years is profoundly unique. Nobody else will experience that moment and it will never arise again. It was born, it lived, and it died &ndash; gone forever. If we are not fully aware of all that we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch in each and every moment then maybe we have to conclude that we are not fully alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pali word for mindfulness is&nbsp;&lsquo;<em>sati&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>which means &lsquo;<em>to remember</em>&rsquo; &ndash; in the sense that we should remember to be aware of all that we experience in the present moment. Given the present moment is made up of countless happenings and occurrences, the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness outline four key areas that can be used as focus points for our concentration: (i) the body (starting with the breath), (ii) feelings, (iii) thoughts and mental processes, and (iv) the environment around us. Basically then, the best way to practice mindfulness is to start by becoming aware of our breathing, then expand our meditative awareness to encompass the body, then feelings and thoughts, and finally the environment in which we find ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The health benefits of mindfulness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research studies have shown that over 80 per cent of British adults believe that modern-day pressured lifestyles lead to stress and illness and that their health can be improved by slowing down and learning to be mindful of the present moment. According to the latest research findings, mindfulness meditation can be beneficial for improving a wide variety of health conditions including stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, eating disorders, and even problems relating to sexual performance. In fact, some forms of mindfulness meditation are now recommended by the&nbsp;<em>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&nbsp;</em>for the treatment of specific types of depression. In addition to its medical benefits, scientific research has also shown that mindfulness can improve intellectual functioning and memory capacity &ndash; including in school-age children. Engaging in mindfulness regularly has also been shown to improve people&rsquo;s spiritual wellbeing as well as their overall sense of purpose in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five tips for practising mindfulness effectively</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Adopt a suitable meditation posture</em>: The first thing to think about when starting to practice mindfulness meditation is to adopt a suitable meditation posture. The most important things to keep in mind are that your posture is stable and that you are comfortable (because a good physical posture leads to a good mental posture). Some people prefer to sit cross-legged on a meditation cushion whilst others prefer sitting upright on a chair. It&rsquo;s simply a matter of personal preference &ndash; either position can work well. In an eight-week group mindfulness program we developed called Meditation Awareness Training (MAT), the analogy of a mountain is used to help participants understand the most appropriate posture for meditation. A mountain has a definite presence, it is upright and stable, yet at the same time it is without tension and does not have to strain to maintain its posture &ndash; it is relaxed, content, and deeply-rooted in the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Follow the breath</em>: As part of mindfulness practice, observing the breath is used as a kind of &lsquo;meditative anchor&rsquo; to help with concentration and with maintaining an open-awareness of the present moment. Being fully aware of the in-breath and out-breath helps to &lsquo;tie the mind&rsquo; to the present moment and to slow down our thought processes. If you&rsquo;re somebody who has difficulty concentrating, then try counting the breath from one to ten, and then back to one. Similarly, you might find it helpful to quietly guide yourself with phrases such as &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am fully aware of my in-breath; breathing out, I am fully aware of my out-breath</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am here; breathing out, I am now</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>breathing in, there is nowhere I need to be; breathing out, I am already home</em>&rdquo;. One thing to remember when following the breath during meditation is that it is very important not to force your breathing &ndash; just let the breath follow its natural course and allow it to calm and deepen on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Carry your meditation cushion with you</em>: Just as conditions such as the sun, rain, and nutrients are required for a seed to grow into a blossoming flower, meditative development requires us to make the &lsquo;right effort&rsquo; at all times. Sometimes people try to cram in their mindfulness practice with all of the other activities of their lives and they make the excuse that they don&rsquo;t have time to practice. However, this approach often leads to a stressful attitude towards mindfulness and for some people the practice can quickly start to become a chore. Therefore, the trick is to not create a separation between your mindfulness practice and the rest of your life. In fact, it&rsquo;s when you blow out your candles and stand up from your meditation cushion (or chair) that the practice of mindfulness really begins. While sitting or writing at the computer, tidying-up at home, cooking the dinner, or doing the weekly food shop, do your best to be mindful and to remember to observe your breathing. Real meditators are those who can practice &lsquo;on the job&rsquo; and this is why some meditation teachers tell their students to carry their meditation cushions with them at all times. Try not to battle with yourself &ndash; make the present moment your home and simply bring your awareness to whatever you are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Make use of mindfulness reminders</em>: Based on our own experience of teaching and researching MAT, those that best manage to integrate their mindfulness practice into everyday life tend to be the ones who show the greatest improvements in overall levels of psychological and spiritual wellbeing. One helpful way of maintaining mindfulness during everyday activities is to use &lsquo;<em>mindfulness reminders</em>&rsquo;. An example of a mindfulness reminder is an hour chime (e.g., from a wrist-watch or desktop computer), that, upon sounding, can be used as a trigger to gently bring the mind back to the present moment and to the natural flow of the in-breath and out-breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Have realistic expectations and keep practicing:</em>&nbsp;Finally &ndash; as with many things in life &ndash; it is not uncommon for people to begin practising mindfulness enthusiastically, but then give up as soon as a minor difficulty is encountered. One reason why some people don&rsquo;t stick at their practice is because they have unrealistic expectations. Mindfulness is not a quick-fix solution. Long-lasting spiritual and personal growth require perseverance and a great deal of practice. Thinking that mindfulness meditation can immediately solve all of your problems or change your life overnight is a mistake. However, just as all effects follow a cause, the day-in day-out integrating of all aspects of your life with present-moment awareness will gradually begin to soften the conditioned mind and &ndash; over time &ndash; allow rays of tranquillity and insight to slowly break through. When correctly practiced, mindfulness is extremely hard work and requires us to be patient and compassionate with ourselves. However, mindfulness also requires us to thoroughly enjoy life no matter what situation we find ourselves in. The practice of accepting and getting to know our mind and true selves during mindfulness meditation &ndash; including those parts of our character that we&rsquo;d sometimes prefer didn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; can be really hard work, but it should also be a lot of fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The authors of this article are Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D.

(102, 'Meditate for More Profitable Business', 'mind', 'business', 'meditation', '', '', '<p><em>Evidence shows meditation can improve business decisions and save your company from expensive investment mistakes, so meditate for more profitable business writes Zoe Kinias and Andrew Hafenbrack of INSEAD Knowledge.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a practice rooted in Hinduism and adopted by those seeking spiritual guidance but meditation has become an increasingly popular practice amongst the C-suite elite. With CEOs such as Rupert Murdoch (News Corp); Bill Ford (Ford Motor Company); Rick Goings (Tupperware); and Marc Benioff (Salesforce.com) all touting its benefits, executive coaches are picking up on the trend introducing mindful techniques to programmes to calm the mind&rsquo;s &lsquo;chatter&rsquo;, assist focus and manage stress. But new empirical evidence suggests it&rsquo;s more than just a &lsquo;feel good&rsquo; exercise, and as little as 15 minutes of meditation can actually help people make better, more profitable decisions, by increasing resistance to the &lsquo;sunk cost bias&rsquo;. The sunk cost bias &ndash; also known as the sunk cost fallacy or the sunk cost effect &ndash; is recognised as one of the most destructive cognitive biases affecting organisations today. Put simply, it&rsquo;s the tendency to continue an endeavour once an investment has been made in an attempt to recoup or justify &lsquo;sunk&rsquo; irrecoverable costs. The phenomenon is not new; psychological scientists have been studying the &lsquo;escalation of commitment&rsquo; since the mid-1970s, noting its ability to distort rational thought and skew effective decision-making. Often it&rsquo;s a subconscious action, which can result in millions of dollars being invested into a project, not because it&rsquo;s a sound investment but because millions of dollars have already been spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AVOIDING THE TRAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s a mind trap you can avoid as suggested by the paper&nbsp;<em>Debiasing the Mind Through Meditation: Mindfulness and the Sunk Cost Bias</em>&nbsp;by Andrew Hafenbrack, INSEAD PhD student in Organisational Behaviour, Zoe Kinias, INSEAD Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Sigal Barsade, the Joseph Frank Bernstein Professor of Management at The Wharton School. Their research shows just 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation &ndash; such as concentrating on breathing or doing a body scan &ndash; helps raise resistance to this problematic decision process, and open the way to more rational thinking. &ldquo;Prior research shows the more we invest in something (financially, emotionally, or otherwise), the harder it is to give up that investment and the more inclined we are to escalate a commitment,&rdquo; Hafenbrack notes. &ldquo;In many cases negative emotions; fear, anxiety, regret, even guilt or worry over past decisions, subconsciously play a part in the decision-making process.&rdquo; Most noted examples include the U.S. military campaigns in Vietnam in the 1960s, and more recently in the Middle East, when mounting casualties made it increasingly difficult for the U.S. government to withdraw. On the business front companies regularly fall victim to the bias when faced with decisions on whether to pump money into a product after being scooped by a competitor, or to continue an investment as costs skyrocket beyond initial estimates. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a matter of a product just not selling as well as expected, as was the case with the Concorde supersonic jet when France and Britain continued their investment long after it was known the aircraft was going to be unprofitable. The sunk cost bias can also be exacerbated by anticipated regret, the result of thinking too much about what may, or may not, occur in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUILDING RESISTANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the result, says Kinias, of both emotional and temporal processes. MRI brain scans show the mind&rsquo;s natural state constantly jumps around, flicking between ideas, switching from the past to the future to the present in seconds. Through a series of studies Hafenbrack, Kinias and Barsade hypothesised, and found that mindfulness meditation, by focusing on the present, quiets this mind-wandering process, diminishing the negative feelings that distort thinking, thereby boosting resistance to the sunk cost bias. They began the research with a correlational study demonstrating the link between trait mindfulness and an individual&rsquo;s ability to resist sunk costs. As people vary in how mindful they are by disposition, volunteers were first assessed for this trait. They were then asked to make decisions based on ten scenarios. Some were business-related; others were simple choices like whether to attend a music festival that had been paid for when illness and bad weather made enjoyment unlikely. As expected, the results indicated that higher trait mindfulness in volunteers translated into their having more resistance to include sunk costs in their decisionmaking process. In subsequent studies the team looked at the causal relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sunk cost bias in both laboratory and online settings. In each case, one group of volunteers was led through a breathing meditation (a form of mindfulness meditation) while another (the control group) underwent a mind-wandering induction, a simple procedure replicating the normal mental state. All volunteers were then given a sunk-cost dilemma and asked to make a decision. In each study &ndash; whether it was online or in the laboratory &ndash; volunteers who had undergone mindfulness practice were significantly more likely to resist the sunk cost bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LETTING GO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was surprising, says Kinias, was the magnitude of the affect that came after such a short period of meditation. &ldquo;In one of our experiments more than half the participants in the control condition committed the sunk cost bias whereas only 22 per cent committed it following the 15 minute mindfulness meditation &ndash; that&rsquo;s a pretty dramatic effect.&rdquo; &ldquo;There may be cases when processing of the past can be useful for making decisions,&rdquo; she concedes, &ldquo;but what our research suggests is that people make better choices in the present moment when letting go of sunk costs is required to make the best decision.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>ZOE KINIAS, INSEAD Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour, and Andrew Hafenbrack, INSEAD PhD student in Organisational Behaviour with Jane Williams, Editor, Knowledge Arabia.

While in Dubai recently, he sat down with Awakenings to reveal how chanting transformed him from a &ldquo;brutally unhappy&rdquo; young man into the &lsquo;Elvis of meditational mantra music&rsquo;&hellip; and what chanting can do for you. Words by Tamara Pitelen.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it simply, chanting mantras is the ongoing repetition of divine names wrapped in a package of&nbsp;rhythm and melody, said Krishna Das to the large Dubai audience who turned out one Saturday night in April to hear him chant and play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just like a sugar-coated pill, the medicine we need to heal is the names of these gods while the music and chanting is the sweet syrup that makes it palatable,&rdquo; says Das, who is commonly known as KD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Through the repetition of divine names we gradually uncover what&rsquo;s already in us, which is divine love &ndash; who we really are. These names are the names of the place within us that are who we really are when we&rsquo;re not obsessed with external things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The repetition of these names is very powerful. Gradually something happens that we&rsquo;re not prepared for &ndash; we get happy. This happens through the release of obsessive&nbsp;thinking. It&rsquo;s a simple kind of happiness, it&rsquo;s not the kind that depends on anything other people give to you; whether people are good to you or bad to you or if you&rsquo;re getting the kind of thing you want in life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE POWER OF CHANTING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to KD, the fact that these words and sounds have been used as the names of deities is not why they are powerful &ndash; the power lies in the vibration and real meaning of the sounds. The names came before the deities themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where do the chants come from? We don&rsquo;t know. On one hand people might say &lsquo;these are the names of the Hindu deities&rsquo; but what does that mean? It&rsquo;s the same if you say, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re God&rsquo;s names&rsquo;. What does that mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These words, these mantras and sounds, have a frequency, a vibration. They carry the transforming power of the real meaning of what they are. This real meaning is not intellectual or emotional; it&rsquo;s experiential.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a mantra usually begins with Om or Aum &ndash; the primordial sound; the sound said to have its origins at the time of the creation of the cosmos &ndash; also referred to as the &lsquo;Big Bang&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But don&rsquo;t take anything on blind faith, says KD. &ldquo;Try the practice and see how you feel. It&rsquo;s never going to be what you think it is because your thinking is limited by what you know with your senses and your mind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GROOVES AND GURUS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That mantra chanting has the power to transform your life is something KD has learnt first hand. As a young man he was, he says, &ldquo;brutally unhappy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was very, very unhappy when I&nbsp;was young. I felt incomplete; I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t get what I wanted, I didn&rsquo;t have good relationships with women and I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying life at all. A lot of it had&nbsp;to do with my parents and the way I grew up. They were good people but they were emotional disasters so I didn&rsquo;t have tools to be with people or get what I wanted. I had a tremendous longing to be happy and I was looking for something. So I went to all these swamis who came to America but nobody ever really turned me on. Then I met a guy who changed everything. His name was Ram Dass. I walked into the room where he was sitting and without a word being spoken, I immediately knew that whatever it was I was looking for, it was real; it existed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After meeting Ram Dass in 1968, KD flew to India to study &ndash; turning down an invite to join a band called Blue Oyster Cult, which went on to be one of the most successful rock bands of the 70s. In India KD discovered chanting and that changed everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what the words meant but I felt something. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what the words mean. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the words are from India, or from Islam or that this is a Christian chant. What matters is what you&rsquo;re feeling. Get in touch with the feelings within you because the more time you spend listening to that music inside&nbsp;of you, so to speak, the less time you&rsquo;re moping around thinking, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not having&nbsp;a good hair day&hellip;&rsquo; You learn to sit more deeply in yourself and you spend less time in negative states of mind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE ART OF HAPPINESS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The thing is, everybody wants the same thing. The biggest arsehole in the world wants the same thing &ndash; to be happy. Some people think they get happy by hurting other people but those actions come out of unhappiness, desperation, frustration and&nbsp;not knowing that there&rsquo;s anything else to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Money, careers, relationships&hellip; that&rsquo;s&nbsp;all the stuff that we think is going to make us happy. But nothing is going to make us happy. Happiness is our true nature&hellip; real happiness is what we are underneath all that, all the time. To find that place is what we want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The problem is that in western culture, the whole idea of inner transformation is lost. You grow up, you work, you drink beer and you die. And nobody says there&rsquo;s anything more to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When people chant with me or hear the CDs, they feel something that they didn&rsquo;t feel before. They think &lsquo;wow&rsquo; and want it again.&nbsp;So they start looking and that&rsquo;s called the spiritual path. It just means you recognise that nothing material in this world is ever going to be enough. Not even the affection of another human being is enough because we&rsquo;ve all had affection at times but where are we now? It&rsquo;s not enough. It&rsquo;s good and we want it but there&rsquo;s a limit. We want to find something that doesn&rsquo;t have limits and it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable to&nbsp;want that because it exists and that&rsquo;s what the chanting points us too. The feelings come from this limitless space of love that lives within each one of us. That&rsquo;s who we really are. It&rsquo;s so simple really. Simple but not so easy. You have to make some effort. We spend a lot of time chasing stuff. How many times have I been out to clubs looking for a girlfriend? If I&rsquo;d spent all that time at home meditating, I&rsquo;d be divine by now!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/krishna-das-on-the-power-of-chanting/www.krishnadasmusic.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.krishnadasmusic.com&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;HOW TO INTRODUCE&nbsp;CHANTING INTO YOUR LIFE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That which uplifts by constant repetition is a mantra. The sound vibration of a mantra permeates every cell of your being and is beyond the cognition of the mind. For example, what exactly happens when you chant Om? It shifts your energetic vibration.

Tamara Pitelen discovers first hand why the Vipassana 10 day silent meditation retreat is not to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s it like not speaking for 10 days while meditating all day every day from 4.30am? I won&rsquo;t lie; it&rsquo;s no walk in the park. At least it wasn&rsquo;t for me. The ultimate goal may&nbsp;be purity of the mind, happiness, and an end to suffering for all beings but there are moments that are abject torture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like me and if it&rsquo;s your first time (yes, some people do the retreat many times over), your mood over the 10 days will swing from incandescent rage, to irritation, sadness, and abject misery as well as moments of gouge- your-own-eyes-out boredom. Dotted with moments of contented peace, thankfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it&rsquo;s so arduous, why do it? Personal and spiritual growth mainly. You do it to clean out some of the negative thought patterns and limiting beliefs rooted deep&nbsp;in the foundations of your subconscious mind, leaving you more peaceful, loving, happy and compassionate. You do it because, if you really manage to shush your mind&rsquo;s white noise, you may connect and communicate with something greater<br />\r\nthan yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE MIND GRIND</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what was it like? Every morning for the 10 days, myself and 23 other students &ndash; 13 men and 11 women &ndash; were woken at 4am by the banging of a gong. By 4.30am we had to be in the Dhamma hall for meditation. We meditated for two hours in the early morning, three hours in the mid morning, four hours after lunch then another hour after a 5pm tea break. Finally, two hours of video lectures from S.N Goenka &ndash; the man behind it all (see FAQ box). Bed and lights out at 9pm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first three days are the hardest. That&rsquo;s when the days ahead seem stretched out like centuries. At the end of the second or third day, you could literally cry at the thought of another week of it. Some people do literally cry. On my second evening, after a silent dinner with the other women on the retreat, one woman sat at the table sobbing into her hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re not meditating you&rsquo;re silently eating or showering or resting&nbsp;on your bed. That&rsquo;s it. Apart from being forbidden to speak, it&rsquo;s also forbidden&nbsp;to read, write, communicate with others using gestures or eye contact, mix with the opposite sex, or do any exercise beyond short periods of walking on specially marked, segregated walking paths. Why? Because the idea is that for 10 days you are focused completely inwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I sat and I sat and I sat. I sat cross- legged on a cushion till my back throbbed with aches and pains and my legs got pins and needles &ndash; which didn&rsquo;t take very long, after three days I had to alternate between the floor and a chair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BRAIN TRASH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meditating for 10 hours a day gives you an awful lot of time to think and try as I might to stay focused, my mind veered off in some bizarre directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start with, I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the British TV soap Coronation&nbsp;Street for the first couple of days. My brain invented endless new story lines and I had conversations with the characters. When the TV soap obsession died down it was replaced by &ndash; how to put this for a family audience&nbsp;&ndash; an igniting of my libido. Sat for hours in a room of silent people, my brain kicked off&nbsp;an x-rated film fest. There were also spent hours having imaginary arguments with people I knew, rehashing relationship failures ad nauseum and hauling long forgotten fragments of life from my memory vaults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, this is normal. It&rsquo;s the kind of mental trash your brain vomits up to dodge inspection of the really deep painful stuff lodged in the depths of your subconscious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the 10 days, something had shifted. I felt more centred and lighter. Physically as well as emotionally, as it happens. One side effect I didn&rsquo;t expect was losing 2kgs. You don&rsquo;t do Vipassana as a weight-loss boot camp but it&rsquo;s a nice bonus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAQS ABOUT VIPASSANA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. What is Vipassana meditation? One of India&rsquo;s most ancient techniques of meditation, Vipassana means to see things as they really are. It was taught in India more than 2500 years ago, by people who include the Buddha, as a remedy for universal ills caused by negative emotions such as anger, greed, animosity and depression. In the last couple of decades, Vipassana has been revived by S. N. Goenka. Born in Burma, Goenka relocated to India in 1969 to teach Vipassana and is largely responsible for its worldwide revival today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. What is the Vipassana meditation technique?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vipassana is just one way to approach meditation. This technique involves observing your breath as well as scanning the body for physical sensations which, when found, detachedly observing them in the knowledge that they are impermanent, they will rise and pass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. How much is it? It&rsquo;s free. All expenses are met by donations from previous students who want others to do the course. Make a donation if you want to but there is no pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Q. Where can I study Vipassana? Check out www.dhamma.org for a list of worldwide centres and courses schedule. Here in the UAE, the retreats are held in Ras Al Khaimah.

Here&rsquo;s what we learnt&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us are driven by fears to some degree.

What would bring me joy at this moment?&rsquo; Even&nbsp;if you can&rsquo;t come up with an answer straight away, if you ask yourself the question every day, throughout the day, then what you&rsquo;re doing, without even being aware of it, is getting out of your head space and going into your heart space. Fear comes from the head; joy comes from the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do anything drastic, like suddenly quit your dead-end job, or walk out on an unfulfilling relationship. No, life changes unfold without force when you move from fear-based to joy-based decision- making and choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To introduce joy, ask yourself, &lsquo;What do I enjoy doing? What makes me feel alive? What makes me feel loved? How can I increase the love and respect I have for myself?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you become aware of what brings you joy; the more you will see it reflected in your physical life. You will attract different things because you&rsquo;ll be talking about different things. Instead of, &lsquo;I hate my job but I need the money,&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be talking and thinking about that holiday you&rsquo;re planning, or your dream job. And as you&nbsp;talk about these joyful things, you&rsquo;ll attract different people and situations. Someone&nbsp;will say, &lsquo;hey, you know that thing you said, well I saw an opportunity for you.&rsquo; Your life will gradually change without you having to worry about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXERCISE 1 &ndash; SPEAK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day, say to yourself: &ldquo;I am a child of the universe and I am loved unconditionally. I am doing the best I can and I will receive only compassion and unconditional love.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep a check on that inner critical voice and change what it says. When you catch your inner critic using words like &lsquo;shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; and &lsquo;mustn&rsquo;t&rsquo;, replace them with, &lsquo;I am lovable and I am doing my best.&rsquo; Love yourself and choose what brings you joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXERCISE 2 &ndash; WRITE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Write five positive things about yourself every day. They don&rsquo;t need to be a big deal, e.g. &lsquo;I held the door open for the lady with the pram&rsquo;, &lsquo;I made a great cup of coffee&rsquo; or &lsquo;I gave a good presentation in today&rsquo;s meeting&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXERCISE 3 &ndash; DREAM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have dreams but don&rsquo;t set goals. Goals are limiting while dreams are liberating. What&rsquo;s the difference? Dreams come from your heart; goals come from your head. When you believe in yourself, you allow yourself to dream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a race of people, we&rsquo;ve become such goal-oriented go-getters, &lsquo;I must do this,&nbsp;be this, work harder, get better, be more&hellip;&rsquo; We&rsquo;ve forgotten who we are and that&rsquo;s why people are so lost. But the more you pursue, the more you push away. For example, the less you need a partner, the more you&rsquo;re attractive to a partner and vice-versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EXERCISE 4 &ndash; ALLOW</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of pursuing, chasing and fighting for something, allow things to happen. Before you go to sleep, close your eyes, relax all your muscles and say: &lsquo;I release everything to Universal Energy&rsquo; and feel&nbsp;as though you&rsquo;re releasing everything. Perhaps let out a deep breath as a symbol of releasing all fears, inhibitions and anxieties. Then say, &lsquo;When I wake up in the morning, I will be at peace and calm.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the morning, when you wake&nbsp;up, say, &lsquo;I give my day over to Universal Energy. I allow Universal Energy to work through me and I trust in the outcome.&rsquo;&nbsp;Through the day when you feel fear or stress, speak to Universal Energy, say, &lsquo;I gave my day to you and since you have given me this issue, I want you to deal with it.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t ask for specifics because you&rsquo;re&nbsp;limiting what comes to you. Feel grateful for what you have and allow Universal Energy to work through you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE FEAR CHECKLIST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are your decisions born of love or fear? Are you doing things each day and making choices each day because you want to and it feels good or because you&rsquo;re fearful if you don&rsquo;t? If you&rsquo;re not sure, ask yourself the following&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Do I fear being disliked or criticised?<br />\r\n&bull; Do I fear failing?<br />\r\n&bull; Do I fear death?<br />\r\n&bull; Do I fear global warming and pollution?<br />\r\n&bull; Do I fear toxins in the environment, microwaves, phones,&nbsp;food additives?<br />\r\n&bull; Do I fear not having enough money in retirement? &bull; Where do I suppress my creativity/intelligence?<br />\r\n&bull; Where do I compromise my integrity?<br />\r\n&bull; Where do I betray myself?<br />\r\n&bull; When do I say yes when I mean no?<br />\r\n&bull; When do I violate myself?&nbsp;(Could be food, cigarettes, alcohol, promiscuity.)<br />\r\n&bull; When do I seek approval to be myself?<br />\r\n&bull; When do I not follow my heart?<br />\r\n&bull; When am I afraid to speak my truth?</p>\r\n', 'girl-facing-sun-31.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:42:25'),

Tamara Pitelen interview Anita Moorjani, author of Dying to Be Me.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>In 2006, after a four-year fight with cancer, Anita Moorjani was in a coma and virtually dead&hellip; but instead of dying, as the doctors predicted, she woke from the coma and &ndash; miraculously &ndash; was completely free of the devastating cancer that had destroyed her body. What happened, she says, is that she visited the &lsquo;other side&rsquo; where she received a profound understanding about why she had developed cancer. With that clarity came healing and today, seven years later, she enjoys full health and happiness. While in Dubai recently, Anita sat down with Awakenings magazine to recount the incredible story of what happened while she was &lsquo;dead&rsquo;; how that Near Death Experience saved her life, and the important message she came back to share with the rest of us.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had to sum up in one word why I got cancer &ndash; that word would be &lsquo;fear&rsquo;. I was diagnosed with lymphatic&nbsp;cancer in 2002. By December 2005, I was in Intensive Care. I weighed 85 pounds and my muscles had deteriorated to the point where I couldn&rsquo;t walk or hold up my own head. I had egg-sized tumours from the base of my skull, all around my neck, under my arms and in my chest, all the way down to my abdomen. I had fluid in the brain as well as open, weeping skin lesions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My lungs were filled with fluid so&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t breathe without an oxygen tank. I was no longer absorbing food so nutrition was by way of a tube through my throat. There was one tube in my nose for oxygen and one in my throat for food. I was in a bad way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THROUGH THE VEIL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The doctor told my husband that I had three months to live, at best, but six weeks later I went into a coma. My family was told that these were my final hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while everyone around me&nbsp;thought I was in a coma, I had never felt so incredible, so alive and so beautifully calm. I was aware of everything that was happening around me, I knew what the doctors were doing and I could hear conversations they&nbsp;were having up the corridor, I was aware of how upset my family were. I was also aware of my brother in India trying frantically to getonaflighttocomeandseemeandI could feel what everyone was feeling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was also aware of being supported and guided by other non-physical beings, including the spirit of my father who had died 10 years earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to comprehend when you live in a physical body but in that realm&nbsp;I was aware of everything at once and everything made complete sense. Without the boundaries of my physical body, it was like I existed everywhere. I expanded; my consciousness had no bounds. I was no longer my physical body, I was no longer in pain. The cancer was all gone and it was the most incredible feeling. I felt no attachment to my limp body, I felt free, liberated and magnificent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEING LOVE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then had a sense of what I can only describe as pure, unconditional love in a way I never have before. I felt renewed, like I had come home and I saw with crystal- clear clarity how all the choices I&rsquo;d made in my life had led me to cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this &lsquo;all-seeing&rsquo; perspective, I understood that the reason I got ill was through living my whole life out of fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fear can be very subtle and living from a place of fear means that every small decision you make, all your choices, are made out of a fear of&nbsp;the consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was me. For example, I feared what people thought of me so I was a people pleaser. If I did nice things for people, it wasn&rsquo;t because it brought me joy, it was because I wanted them to like me. Same with the jobs I did. I worked out of fear of not having enough money, fear of being a loser. I believed I had to pursue this, chase that, get ahead. Ironically, I was paranoid about getting cancer so I was vegan and I consumed only organic foods. I was into macrobiotics and vitamin supplements, I even grew my own wheatgrass for juicing! I was obsessive about food but not because I loved my&nbsp;life, my body or my health but because I&nbsp;feared illness, I feared getting cancer. So the big clarity for me was, &lsquo;Oh my goodness, all I have to do is love myself, love my life and make my choices out of love not fear.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you can&rsquo;t just say, &lsquo;ok, I&rsquo;m going to stop fearing&rsquo;. Fear has to be replaced and what it must be replaced with is self-love. While in this other realm, I learned that the reason I was so fearful was that I didn&rsquo;t love myself enough. The more you love yourself, the less room there is&nbsp;for fear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ALWAYS THE OUTSIDER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My lack of self-love stemmed from always feeling that I didn&rsquo;t fit in, I was always&nbsp;an outsider. I was the only Indian kid in&nbsp;a British school in Hong Kong. The kids in my building were Chinese, no matter where I went I felt I didn&rsquo;t belong. I always tried hard to be accepted and I was bullied because I was a different race, a different culture with different values. For example, if I went to a British kid&rsquo;s home, they ate with a fork and knife. If I brought that child to my home, my parents ate with their fingers and British kids were taught that picking up food with our hands was dirty; so there was always this feeling of being inferior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this new profound clarity of how a lack of self-love had manifested in me as cancer, I understood that the cancer was not some punishment for anything I&rsquo;d done wrong, nor was it bad karma. Where I was at that point in time was a culmination<br />\r\nof every decision, every choice and every thought of my entire life. My many fears and my great power had manifested as&nbsp;this disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also knew that, now that I&rsquo;d understood the magnificence of my true self, that my body would heal rapidly if I chose to go back to life. I understood that my body is only a reflection of my internal state. If my inner self were aware of its magnificence and connection with All- That-Is, my body would soon reflect that and heal rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STAY OR GO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was my father&rsquo;s spirit who communicated to me that I had the choice whether to go back into my body or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said, &lsquo;Sweetheart, I want you to know that it&rsquo;s not your time to come home yet.&nbsp;But it&rsquo;s still your choice whether you want to come with me or go back into your body.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t want to come back because my body was dying and had caused so much suffering to my family and me but I also knew that my body would heal very quickly now that I understood everything. I knew too that I had a job still to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I heard my father say, &lsquo;Now that you know the truth of who you really are, go back and live your life fearlessly!&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I did and my recovery completely astounded the doctors. Just four days after coming out of the coma, my tumours had shrunk by 70 per cent and the fluid in my lungs had receded so they moved me out&nbsp;of ICU and into a regular room. Within&nbsp;five weeks I was strong enough to go home and despite a barrage of tests, the doctors couldn&rsquo;t find a trace of cancer. They couldn&rsquo;t explain it. The oncologist said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what to write in your medical file, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIVING FEARLESSLY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven years later, Anita enjoys optimum health and happiness. She lives life fearlessly; doing only what brings her&nbsp;joy. Her life&rsquo;s purpose is to spread the message she learnt during her Near Death Experience, which is the importance of living fearlessly and loving yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;During my Near Death Experience, I knew I had a reason to come back. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was initially but I knew I didn&rsquo;t have to figure it out or chase it; it would unfold before me. I also knew it would involve reaching a lot of people but I had no idea how, what, where, or why it would happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But I do have a burning drive to tell my story because it was such a revelation to me. I&rsquo;d watched my cancer heal and I wanted people to know about it. So I blogged about what I&rsquo;d been through on the internet and one day I got an email from a Hay House author, Wayne W. Dyer, telling me they wanted to publish my story. That&rsquo;s how my book Dying To Be Me came into existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I would like to have an effect on how cancer as a disease is viewed. I&rsquo;d like help change the way people look at cancer and remove the fear. I don&rsquo;t believe that the cure lies in medicine; scientists are only studying the symptoms and creating drugs to mask them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cases like mine are a disease of the mind and the soul, not the body. The physical manifestation of disease is merely a symptom of something much deeper. I would like to help people love this life and see it for the gift it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>To buy Anita&rsquo;s book, Dying To Be&nbsp;Me, send an email to hariharan.v@ hayhouse.co.in and raj.lakshmi@ hayhouse.co.in.

(107, 'Islam and Aromatherapy', 'mind', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>A pioneer of aromatherapy was Islam&rsquo;s own father of medicine, Abu Ali Al-Hussain Ibn Sina aka Avicenna. Samar Khan explains Ibn Sina&rsquo;s view of the healing powers of oils and scent.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever wonder where Dubai&rsquo;s chain of Bin Sina pharmacies got its name? Abu Ali Al-Hussain Ibn Sina was&nbsp;the Arabian father of Medicine from Islam&rsquo;s Golden Era around 1000 AD. In the west he was known as Avicenna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered the inventor of distillation, Persian-born Ibn Sina refined traditional distillation processes and invented a<br />\r\npipe that used steam to distill plants and produce true essential oils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Middle Ages, the use of plants for medicinal oils and fragrances was commonplace across the world but as the Dark Ages drew a shadow over Europe, their use became controlled by the church. It was thanks to Arabia and Ibn Sina that the herbal traditions of the ancient world were kept alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A prolific scholar of international fame, Ibn Sina wrote more than 200 books including the five volume Canon of Medicine, which was studied in Europe&nbsp;from the 12th to the 17th centuries and contained all medical knowledge of the time. Another of his books was on cardiac drugs and he was one of the first people in antiquity to point out the role of emotions in health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCIENCE OF SCENT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a science, aromatherapy got its name from French doctor Rene Gattefosse<br />\r\nwho, in the early 1900s, studied the specific healing properties of the complex constituents of essential oils, which are<br />\r\nthe key to their therapeutic activities. According to Dr Kristie Burns of The Avicenna Institute, an online institute in the United States: &ldquo;This is one of the main reasons why synthetic compounds do not have the same effect. There are now 30,000 known chemical compounds identified in essential oils such as aldehydes, phenols, ketones, esters and monoterpenes. It is important to make sure one is using the&nbsp;purest form of essential oils in order to receive maximum benefit from them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Islam, the healing power of scents, essential oils and traditional oils as a&nbsp;way to correct imbalances that are the source of disease is widely accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The understanding of these essential oil remedies and the methods of extracting essential oils from plants have been passed down to the present time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRAYER, WIVES AND SCENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings Be Upon Him) said, &ldquo;There are three things of this world I have been made to prefer &ndash; prayer, wives and scents.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Burns states that: &ldquo;Many Muslims know this saying yet many fail to realise that scents were used in the time of the Prophet, not just for pleasuring the senses but to achieve, indicate and maintain spiritual states.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prophet&rsquo;s wife Aisha, who recorded&nbsp;the majority of his sayings and actions,&nbsp;wrote: &ldquo;Whenever the Prophet took the bath&nbsp;of purification, he asked for the Hilab or&nbsp;some other scent. He used to take it in his&nbsp;hand, rub it first over the right side of his&nbsp;head and then over the left and then rub the&nbsp;middle of his head with both hands.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only was this calming but it would &nbsp;also put him in a state of cleanliness where all his senses were channeled towards reaching a state of perfect connection with God in his prayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Muslims use generous amounts of rosewater to fragrance mosques and other holy places. In emulation of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), many have adopted his daily rituals in order to enhance their physical and spiritual selves. The idea being that if the outward self is pure and clean then the inward reflects the same state. Pure rosewater is used for purification along with juniper, lemon, pine, sage, lavender, cypress and rosemary oils. Most can be found in Dubai in the Deira Spice Souk located between Baniyas Rd, Al- Sabkha Rd and Al-Abra St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO USE ROSEWATER OILS IN DAILY LIFE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avicenna used oils for daily healing and preventative care. One such oil is rosewater but make sure you are using pure rose water and not the rose essence. Pure rose water is derived from actual rose petals and but rose essence may just be water scented with rose and may have added chemicals added. Here are some examples of using it in daily life:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mood: Love is the metaphysical emotion behind rosewater. A spiritually healing plant, it is good for the heart chakra. Put a few drops into the bath, use in a diffuser or burn as incense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinal: Rosewater oil has anti-septic, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anti-aging: A good skin toner, rosewater oil prevents wrinkles from forming and is a great fragrance for the body and hair. It hydrates dry skin as a natural moisturiser and Cleopatra is said to have often bathed in it (what isn&rsquo;t that woman said to have bathed in?!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutritional: The syrup of rosewater can be added to water or milk as it has beneficial nutrients like flavanoids, antioxidants, tannins and essential vitamins like A, C, D, E and B3. It is also a mild sedative and an anti-depressant. It can help enhance moods, relieve nervous tension, improve skin texture and calm the mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SAMAR KHAN is a student of The Avicenna Institute and a consultant of Naturopathic Medicine.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n', 'aromatherapy1.jpg', '2019-07-28 05:22:53'),
(108, 'I ate my own placenta', 'mind', 'body', '', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Yoga teacher and new mother Cheryl Parsons delves into the world of the afterbirth. From capsules and tinctures to raw placenta smoothies, find out why more and more women are choosing to use this amazing organ postpartum&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly dinner party conversation. While I did not whip up a placenta korma, I did&nbsp;effectively ingest my afterbirth in the form of capsules, after the birth of my first baby over six months ago. Now, I&rsquo;m no tree hugging, tie-dye wearing hippie type, but when I heard about using the placenta postpartum during my pre-natal yoga teacher training, I knew it would one day become part of my birth plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months into my pregnancy I told my husband of my plans to get my placenta encapsulated &ndash; dried out, ground down and popped into pill form. Well accustomed to my sometimes weird and wonderful &lsquo;yogic&rsquo; ideas, he was surprisingly&nbsp;understanding: &ldquo;Well, it makes sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I mean, after all, we are one of the very few mammals on this earth that do not eat the placenta&hellip; just don&rsquo;t expect me to be trying any.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My intention is certainly not to&nbsp;put you off your cornflakes, but to show you just what an amazing organ the placenta is. For nine months it nurtures and protects a developing foetus, joining mother to baby via&nbsp;the vital umbilical cord. It floods a baby&rsquo;s body with blood, oxygen and nutrients, while secreting hormones to support a healthy pregnancy. However, when baby has finally arrived, for the most part in the Western world, the cord to its life support &lsquo;machine&rsquo; is quickly severed even while it is still pumping, and the placenta is tossed away as medical waste. Robin Lims&nbsp;in his book,&nbsp;<em>Placenta &ndash; The forgotten Chakra</em>, calls it the &ldquo;heroine of gestation&rdquo; and a &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; that should be treated with respect, asking the question: &ldquo;How did the placenta, central to our survival and future well- being, lose its significance and come to be considered garbage?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed in many cultures and religions, the placenta is regarded as highly sacred. Many Muslims bury the placenta under the Islamic belief that it&nbsp;is part of the human body. Eating the placenta or &lsquo;placentophagia&rsquo; has been a common practice for centuries in China, where it is thought to increase milk supply and have anti-ageing properties. In some African nations, the placenta is wrapped and buried under a tree, while in Indonesia it is considered a baby&rsquo;s twin and guardian and must be buried in accordance with sacred traditions. In the animal world, many mammals eat the placenta to speed postpartum recovery and stem blood loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I researched placenta use in Dubai prior to my birth I came across Elizabeth Bain, one of the few women in the UAE who carry out this delicate work. &ldquo;I was always inspired by this lost tradition that was seemingly handed down from women to women within their villages and tribes,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Elizabeth. &ldquo;Yet it wasn&rsquo;t until I trained as a birth doula (birth support partner) that I noticed again how many women were tired, hormonal,&nbsp;depressed, lacked energy and very anxious in the postnatal period. It was then I began to consider what would be of benefit to them to take in a natural, holistic form.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After seeing midwives and doulas offering encapsulation, smoothies&nbsp;and tinctures as a means of natural healing, I began to extensively research the history and benefits. At the same time a doula client who had suffered from severe depression asked me to encapsulate her placenta,&rdquo; Elizabeth continued. &ldquo;She was amazed (and&nbsp;so was I) at how good she felt, how balanced she felt after the birth, how she never felt tired and did not need any medication.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth went on to set up her own services here in Dubai, Placenta Passions, after undergoing extensive training with Full Circle Placenta Encapsulation. The training is meticulous, covering how to prepare the placenta to a very high standard, along with a certification for food hygiene and working with blood-borne viruses. Besides offering the placenta in capsule form, she also makes raw placenta smoothies, something that she says is surprisingly popular in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of women have a placenta smoothie that I make and then take to them in the hospital within a couple of hours of the birth. The rest&nbsp;of their placenta is then made into capsules and a tincture and I also offer placenta prints and cord keepsakes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The biggest feed back I receive&nbsp;is about energy levels, no matter if&nbsp;it is their first baby or their fifth, all&nbsp;my clients have reported a feeling of more energy, better or increased milk supply, quicker healing and surprisingly less hair fall,&rdquo; comments Elizabeth. &ldquo;Other major benefits of consuming the placenta can include guarding against postnatal depression, speeding postpartum recovery, decreasing after- pains and replenishing iron levels, as&nbsp;well as re-balancing hormones such as oxytocin and CRH, which is a natural stress reliever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Childbirth takes so much out of your body, depleting it of essential nutrients as well as creating a massive upheaval to hormonal levels. Personally, this was my first birth and while I have nothing to compare it to,&nbsp;taking my placenta pills did give me the peace of mind that I was giving something back to myself. Although nothing can quite prepare you for the challenges of being a parent, it also helped me to feel I was getting the best, healthy start. While you may not remain convinced, I hope this given you some food for thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benefits of ingesting the placenta are said to include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Increase milk supply and maternalenergy<br />\r\n&bull; Facilitate an easier postpartum recovery<br />\r\n&bull; Replenish depleted iron levels and VitaminB6<br />\r\n&bull; Contains body&rsquo;s natural hormones<br />\r\n&bull; Balances the system post-birth<br />\r\n&bull; Helps uterus return to pre-pregnancy state more quickly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Inka Resch gave birth to first son, Kai, in July&hellip;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had heard that the placenta is a precious resource and was thrilled to learn that it could actually be encapsulated. Easing away from the hormone high of pregnancy and birth rather than having<br />\r\nit just drop off sounded like a smart thing to do. I have to say that my post-birth experience was amazing. I was not tired despite the utter lack of sleep and I felt so happy for weeks and weeks afterwards. I don&rsquo;t know if I can attribute it completely to the placenta capsules, as I have nothing to compare it to, but I have heard from others who have experienced post-birth both with and without them and they noticed a huge difference in mood and energy levels.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CHERYL PARSONS is a 500 hour + Yoga Alliance certified instructor</strong></em><br />\r\n<em><strong>and has been teaching Vinyasa and Hatha Flow at Zen Yoga for nearly five years.

Here she reveals her personal journey to help you with yours.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: There is no one secret, magic key to effortlessly achieving your ideal body weight.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s taken me about 35 years to come to that conclusion and I&rsquo;m writing this in the hope you don&rsquo;t need to take so long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my religiously following&nbsp;the (often contradictory) advice of the traditional weight loss industry, I spent more than three decades failing to get rid of excess body fat. It left me despairing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why could I never manage to permanently shed body fat? Because just like the special combination of numbers it takes to open a padlock, I believe there is a set of different factors that combine to create the code that cracks the puzzle of reaching your ideal body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the really important bit though &ndash; each person has their own individual combination of these factors that they need to figure out before the weight padlock opens&hellip; and stays open. Because I&rsquo;m not talking about the white-knuckled, gritted teeth effort we&rsquo;ve all kept up for weeks even months to shave off the extra kilos&hellip; only to watch them all come right back within<br />\r\na few months &ndash; often bringing their mates with them for a fat party on your belly and thighs. I&rsquo;m talking about your body finding its natural happy place permanently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting back to the special factors, they can be a combination of any or all of&nbsp;the following: Food intolerances, blood sugar imbalances, the famine response, high GI foods, nutrient deficiency and damaged hormonal health through restricted calories, as well as stress raising cortisol levels which turn on your body&rsquo;s &lsquo;fat storage mode&rsquo; &ndash; sustained stress is like taking a &lsquo;fat pill&rsquo;. But that&rsquo;s just some of the physical causes of weight gain. Do not make the mistake of focusing only on the physical because the emotional reasons can be the real, hidden foundation of an ongoing weight issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, some people get fat to avoid physical intimacy; they get fat to avoid relationships because they&rsquo;re afraid of getting rejected; they get fat so they have an excuse for not engaging with life. Perhaps they associate food with love if they&rsquo;ve been brought up by a mama who was always urging them to eat, eat, eat. Or maybe they stuff their face with ice-cream and chocolate because it fills some other kind of emptiness inside &ndash; for a while. For some people, food is a drug and an addiction that&rsquo;s used to suppress painful emotions. Binge eating&nbsp;numbs their pain because some things seem too scary to feel. I say &lsquo;they&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ve done most of the above and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAT GIRL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve officially been on a diet since the age of nine years old when I got my first calorie counting booklet and attempted to stick to a diet of 1000 calories a day. I was a growing nine-year-old girl entering puberty &ndash; a&nbsp;time when a girl&rsquo;s body needs masses of nutrients and energy &ndash; and I was trying to live on 1000 calories a day, a dangerously low amount of calories for anyone but that was the accepted wisdom in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mother had a calorie counting booklet that had a green apple with a tape measure wrapped around it on the cover. I studied that book, memorised all the calories in the foods I ate regularly and planned a daily menu with it. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After two years of failed calorie counting, my mum took me to our local doctor. The doctor confirmed that I was indeed an overweight young 11-year-old lady and sternly told me to apply some good old-fashioned willpower to the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He gave me a diet sheet &ndash; one of the first of hundreds &ndash; that was typical of the kind of thing doing the rounds in the 1970s and 1980s, for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Breakfast: Half a grapefruit, boiled egg, tea or coffee with dash of milk, no sugar.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of thing. A bland, restrictive, punishing diet. I struggled with calorie counting for years but still my body seemed to be fighting me all the way and the numbers on the scales relentlessly crept higher and higher. It seemed that no matter what I did, my body was determined to keep storing fat. I began to see it as an enemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This strict diet was the start of the starve/binge pattern that really took hold in my teens. My weight crept up and up and I reached my heaviest weight at 19 years old &ndash; 20kgs more than I weigh today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIET DEAD ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I tried every crazy concept the billion-dollar diet industry could come&nbsp;up with &ndash; blaming myself when each one inevitably failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I joined Weight Watchers about&nbsp;four times as well as the Jenny Craig Programme. Through grim determination, constant hunger and buckets of diet jelly I did manage to lose a few kilos initially but like a rubber band that&rsquo;s been stretched to the limit, &lsquo;ping&rsquo; I soon sprang back to my old, overweight self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One company called Gioventu put me on a high protein, zero carb diet &ndash; they guaranteed I would lose weight. I stuck with it religiously, living on chicken, eggs, and fish. I didn&rsquo;t lose a gram. They just couldn&rsquo;t understand it. They still took<br />\r\nmy money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What else has there been? Too many to remember. I&rsquo;ve done three-day apples-only fasts and various Slimfast-type plans where all &ldquo;you have to do is replace two meals per day with this delicious and nutritious drink and bla bla bla&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve tried food combining, the GI diet, the alkaline diet, the Atkins diet, &lsquo;Stop the insanity&rsquo; by Susan Powter, the Fit for Life plan, the fibre-based F Plan diet, the Zone Diet, VLCC&hellip; round and round in the same old, pointless circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re thinking, &lsquo;well, she should have been exercising&rsquo; think again. I was an obsessive runner for years, pounding the pavements every day, running half marathons and marathons as well as working as a part-time aerobics instructor in my local gym every night after my day job. The best it did was keep obesity at bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MIND BODY CONNECT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the year 2000, I went to see a Life Coach Counsellor called Sarah. She was the first person who made me see the mind-body-emotions connection. For the first 20 or so years of my dieting efforts, all focus was on the physical. &lsquo;If only I had enough willpower to survive on boiled eggs and grapefruit, I would be thin and find happiness&rsquo; I told myself. Sarah made me realise that excess weight and what we put in our mouths can be motivated by emotions and subconscious drivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click! The first digit in the fat padlock combination dropped into place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You mean subconsciously there&rsquo;s a part of me that wants to be fat?&rdquo; I asked her incredulously. Surely not&hellip; but the more we talked about it, the more I saw how being overweight served me &ndash; in the same way that some people manifest illness to get love and attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next few years, I read countless self-help and diet books as well as went to counselors and alternative healers to deal with the emotional issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You have trust and abandonment issues,&rdquo; said various therapists, on hearing about the bullying stepfather I grew up with after my father had an affair when I was seven years old and walked out on me and my mother and brother to live with his mistress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust men so you are trying to make yourself unattractive by being overweight in order to keep yourself single and safe from rejection&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great, thanks, but how do I stop doing that kind of self-sabotage? To find out I went to psychologists, Pranic healers, Theta healers, Spiritual Response Therapists,&nbsp;Past Life Regression therapists&hellip; no stone remained unturned in my search for answers. And some of these things did help. They were part of the answer but not the whole answer &ndash; the leg of the elephant, if you like. One or two digits in the combination number that would unlock the weight padlock but not all of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACNE AND BODY CLUES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, a couple of years ago, I had a severe outbreak of acne &ndash; it was so unsightly that friends would recoil. Acne is something else I&rsquo;ve been battling since the age of about 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t make a connection between my weight and acne yet both had walked hand in hand with me for decades. The other long-term physical issues I had were candida and thrush, acid reflux, and dry, scaly skin in areas. What&rsquo;s more, medical tests confirmed my adrenal glands were exhausted, my kidneys were struggling and my liver wasn&rsquo;t functioning at full capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t see any connection and I just couldn&rsquo;t understand it. I thought I had one of the healthiest lifestyles I knew. I never, ever ate junk food or takeaways, I was always&nbsp;monitoring what I ate and I was regularly exercising. How could I be so unhealthy? The turning point came when, after three days of living on green smoothies&nbsp;after having become a convert to the raw vegan diet, I&rsquo;d gained more weight. How could I possibly gain weight on liquidised spinach and mango?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the acne on my skin was so bad I felt reluctant to leave the house. What was going on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first clue came via a book called&nbsp;<em>Clear for Life</em>. Author Seppo Pusso had spent years studying the causes of acne and come up with a plan that went against everything recommended by the medical establishment. Pusso said acne was the end result of a bodily system that&nbsp;was in meltdown partly due to swinging blood sugar levels. Interestingly, insulin resistance and weight gain is also the result of fluctuating blood sugar levels. A spike in blood sugar levels triggers the release of insulin and tells the body to store fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click! Another lever fell into place in the fat padlock combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you control your blood sugar levels? For a start, control your intake of carbohydrates that cause blood sugar levels (glucose in the blood) to quickly&nbsp;rise, that is, high GI and GL foods (see www.glycemicindex.com). Also, increase your omega-3 intake as it may help restore insulin sensitivity as well as help prevent insulin resistance from developing. It is in foods such as free-range chicken and eggs, walnuts, salmon and flaxseeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, eat small amounts every three hours, don&rsquo;t overeat and build muscle because exercise improves insulin sensitivity as it creates demand for glucose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SWEET POISON</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Judy Cole, a kinesiologist who used to live in Dubai and wrote a book called&nbsp;<em>The Body Talks: Heal Your Weight</em>, it&rsquo;s insulin that makes you fat and insulin is triggered by the presence of sugar in its various forms. Seppo also talks about this in his ebook. You need to make up your own mind but I believe avoiding added sugar is a major key in unlocking the fat padlock. For more on this, Australian David Gillespie has written a book called&nbsp;<em>Sweet Poison</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gillespie was 40kg overweight, lethargic, sleep-deprived and the father&nbsp;of four, with twins on the way. He had failed for years to lose weight until he&nbsp;did some reading on evolution (&ldquo;why weren&rsquo;t our forebears fat?&rdquo;), and cut sugar &ndash; specifically fructose &ndash; from his diet. Since then he&rsquo;s lost 40kg and studied the connection between added sugar and the world&rsquo;s soaring obesity rate. In the space of 150 years, we have gone from eating no added sugar to more than a kilogram a week. Today, sugar is added even to &lsquo;non sweet&rsquo; foods like bread, tomato sauce, soups and cereals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve come a long way but I&rsquo;m still honing the combination that unlocks my personal fat padlock but so far the main culprits include blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, sugar addiction, emotional triggers, negative benefits, and intolerance to wheat. These are my factors; yours will be different. This is your life and your beautiful, complex body, ditch all the self- criticism and love yourself enough to work it out with kindness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GETTING HELP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the books, websites and people I found helpful for finding the factors contributing to my excess body fat, good luck with finding yours and, who knows, maybe some of these resources will suit you too&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Books:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Women, Food and God by Geneen Roth (Simon and Schuster)<br />\r\n&bull; The Body Talks: Heal Your Weight by Judy Cole (Alchemist)<br />\r\n&bull; The Low GL Diet Made Easy by Patrick Holford (Piatkus)<br />\r\n&bull; Clear For Life ebook by Seppo Pusso, go to www.clear-for-life.com<br />\r\n&bull; Sweet Poison: Why Sugar Makes us Fat by David Gillespie (Viking Australia)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The Sweet Poison Quit Plan, go to www.sweetpoison.com.au &bull; I Quit Sugar, go to www.sarahwilson.com.au</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternative healers:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Dr Heather Eade at the Dubai Mall Medical Centre, www.tdmmc.ae &bull; Melany Oliver, Access Bars therapist, www.melanyoliver.com<br />\r\n&bull; Vanya Silverten, Theta Healer at Illuminations Wellbeing Centre,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.illuminationsworld.com<br />\r\n&bull; Nutritionist Andrew Picken, Bespoke Nutrition, email bespokenutrition@gmail.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRACKING YOUR FAT CODE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is not one cookie-cutter answer &ndash; the combination of keys to your ideal weight is unique to you, your body chemistry and emotional make up. As a starting point to identifying the factors that may be contributing to your lack of success in shifting body fat, ask yourself the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; How&rsquo;s that working for you? How does over-eating or being overweight serve you? This could be a simple procrastination technique to avoid a dull chore or a more complex emotional issue, eg, avoiding physical intimacy. If the latter, perhaps an alternative therapy like Theta, Hypnosis or Access Bars could help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Body clues: Are there any other physical symptoms such as acid reflux or acne that could provide a clue? For example, tell tale signs that food intolerances or insulin resistance is contributing to your weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Belief work: What are your subconscious beliefs about food? Meditate on this, maybe you get an image of your mother telling you to eat up because children in Africa are starving&hellip; thank the belief and release it, visualise it floating away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Stimulants and sugars: Do you consume a lot of sugars and stimulants like caffeine? These spike blood sugar levels, which triggers insulin, which flicks the &lsquo;store body fat&rsquo; switch</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Stress is a &lsquo;fat pill&rsquo;: Have you been under stress for a prolonged period? Stress releases cortisol, which is believed to promote weight gain, especially around the abdominal area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sweat it off: Do you regularly move your body? You don&rsquo;t need to live at the gym, just start with a walk or swim three times a week.</p>\r\n', 'scales-ball-and-chain.jpg', '2019-07-28 05:24:51'),
(110, 'Gong bath meditation', 'mind', 'featured', 'meditation', '', '', '<p><strong><em>Coming clean about gong baths and sound healing.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing out the way; a gong bath doesn&rsquo;t involve water. Oh yes, you may laugh but that was&nbsp;my initial concern when I first heard the term &lsquo;gong bath&rsquo; about 10 years ago. &ldquo;Ooh no,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting into a bath to meditate&hellip;&rdquo; Be assured though, you don&rsquo;t get wet or undressed to have a gong bath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first gonging experience was in Australia in 2002. I was one of about&nbsp;15 people sat in a circle of chairs in a community hall, the gong players were a husband and wife team and they&rsquo;d set the room up with a selection of suspended&nbsp;gongs and Tibetan singing bowls, the latter make an extraordinary high vibrating hum when a rubber mallet is moved around the lip of the bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sat there, eyes closed and the gongmaster started playing and soon I&nbsp;was enveloped in an ocean of swelling, surging and soaring sound. Using various mallets covered with soft cloth, he evoked a symphony of harmonics and tones through a range of strikes, swipes and strokes of the different sized gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one instant, the sounds are like a thunderstorm or the spatter of rain on a tin&nbsp;roof, the next a saxophone or a schoolboy choir. I&rsquo;d never experienced anything like it and it was beautiful &ndash; as though my whole body was being massaged inside and out by the deep vibrations of the reverberating gongs. Then, the gongmaster walked behind everyone in the circle and played&nbsp;a singing bowl over each person&rsquo;s head in turn. The feeling is intense and wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward 10 or so years and I&rsquo;m living in Dubai where, in the last 12 months, gong bath meditations have sprung up across town in various holistic centres. There are now about five certified&nbsp;gongmasters working in Dubai, each offering their own flavour of gonging for meditation, relaxation and healing.&nbsp;One of these people is Aspen Aman who hosts gong baths from The Gong House in Jumeirah 2 near Safa Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GOOD VIBRATIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had my first gong meditation in 2009 here in Dubai,&rdquo; Aman says. &ldquo;The thing that attracted me was that I wanted to meditate but I was so bad at it. I knew meditation was supposed to be really&nbsp;good for you but I found it really hard to&nbsp;silence the monkey mind and stop the chatter in my head. Gonging for me was an easy way into meditation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is gonging so conducive to meditation? Because the sounds switch the brain waves into Theta state, which is the second lowest of frequency of brain waves, consequently and very quickly inducing a state of spontaneous meditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theta brain waves cycle at about four to seven times per second (4 Hz &ndash; 7 Hz), you are in Theta state in the early stages of sleep and as you are waking up; while you&rsquo;re dreaming; when you&rsquo;re in periods of enhanced creativity, as well as&nbsp;deep relaxation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason the gongs can change your brain&rsquo;s wave frequencies is because there is no fixed rhythm to the &lsquo;music&rsquo;. The brain cannot follow this non-rhythmic throng of harmonics so it surrenders to the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Gong players do not play a song, melody or a recognisable pattern,&rdquo; Aman says. &ldquo;So&nbsp;the brain quickly gives up trying to find<br />\r\na pattern and lets go; it disengages from trying to process the sounds as having&nbsp;a logical structure. This allows the left, logical side of the brain to rest while&nbsp;the right, creative side of the brain is stimulated. That&rsquo;s why gong meditation is great for creative inspiration and problem solving &ndash; because a different part of the brain is brought in to work on an issue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the gongs will most often switch your brainwave frequencies to Theta, you may also go even deeper and slip into Delta (one to four hertz), which is the state of deep sleep and complete relaxation. Delta brainwaves bring a number of benefits including reducing cortisol levels &ndash; the hormone released by stress that can damage parts of your body,<br />\r\nand rejuvenation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GOOD GONG</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Humans are hard-wired at a primal level to respond to vibration and percussive sound, Aman says. This has presented itself for centuries across the globe where percussion instruments like drums and gongs&nbsp;are used by all cultures in rituals from calling on the gods to going to war to celebrating, ceremony, initiation and&nbsp;tribal rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very accessible. Vibration affects everyone; people respond to vibration, you can see that with drums, gongs or any percussive instrument. This can be seen through human history across cultures,&rdquo; Aman says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I use the analogy of dropping a pebble into a still pool and observing the ripples spread. It makes all the water in the pond flow and oscillate together and because humans are primarily made of water, the gong vibrations do the same thing to our physical bodies. For a short time, all the water molecules in our body are oscillating in the same direction. It&rsquo;s very relaxing, like an internal massage so it&rsquo;s great for stress release and muscle tension.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>To attend a gong bath with Aspen Aman, join www.meetup.com/The-Gong-House.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GONG BATHS FOR BEGINNERS &ndash; THE FAQS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What is a gong bath?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A form of meditation or relaxation&nbsp;that involves being immersed in sound&nbsp;vibration from someone playing the gongs.<br />\r\nSome people believe the frequencies of these&nbsp;sound vibrations can be healing, emotionally&nbsp;and physically. This is why different gongs are tuned&nbsp;to different frequencies &ndash; in order to work on different parts of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Will I get wet?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. You&rsquo;re immersed in sustained waves of primal sound&hellip; there&rsquo;s no water anywhere, no need for wellies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lie back, relax and let the gongs take you on a journey for an hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What if I fall asleep and (oh horror) snore?</strong></em><br />\r\nDon&rsquo;t worry about it, lots of people do. It doesn&rsquo;t matter and you&rsquo;re still getting the benefits of the gonging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What do I need to bring?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something to lie on, like a yoga mat, a blanket for putting over you and maybe a pillow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group gong meditation is from AED 50 to AED 75 while a private gong meditation is AED 250 to AED 300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What are the benefits of gong meditation?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gong vibrations quickly induce a meditative state by calming the mind and stopping the internal dialogue. Gong therapy is used for stress related issues, depression, fatigue, anger, hostility and fear, as well as physical conditions. Gong meditation can:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; release tension and aid relaxation<br />\r\n&bull; stimulate the circulatory and glandular systems<br />\r\n&bull; rebalance the physical and emotional bodies<br />\r\n&bull; awaken higher states of consciousness conducive to healing and transformation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>WHERE CAN I GO TO HAVE A GONG MEDITATION?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gong House</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspen Aman hosts regular group gong meditations as well as private gong sessions by request.

Michael Jackson.&nbsp; King of Directors?&nbsp; Steven Spielberg.&nbsp; Prince of Pop?&nbsp; Justin Bieber.&nbsp; King of Rock and Roll?&nbsp; Elvis.&nbsp; The ingenious Prince,&nbsp; lead singer of Queen, Freddie Mercury, even Queen Latifa.&nbsp; But what about the Queen of the Catwalk?&nbsp; Naomi Campbell.&nbsp; All Dog Signs!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does that mean for you in the Dog year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it might help you to perceive yourself as royal and do what you want your way.&nbsp; Bring your personality to everything you do and be uncompromising about it.&nbsp; Reveal who you are.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s special about you!&nbsp; And Dog will be impressed.&nbsp; He just wants to see who you really are, how your colours shine.&nbsp; At times, the coming year may feel like a cartoon, full of fun, frolics and just a hint of outrageous drama, but that&rsquo;s what you get when you&rsquo;re dealing with the Iconoclast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An old Chinese proverb says, &ldquo;Dogs are born old and grow younger by the day&rdquo; and they can be recognised by their eternally youthful personalities, looks and ability to connect with young people.&nbsp; This youthful outlook is one of the strongest influences one may feel in 2018.&nbsp; With the Dog&rsquo;s confidence many may be inspired to finally take that balloon ride or go rock climbing or do that special thing they&rsquo;ve always wanted to do but feared that the time had passed.&nbsp; It is the year of the underdog so &nbsp;major feats (especially creative ones) can be achieved.&nbsp; It is a favourable time for small ventures to expand, to launch new brands and a good time to take risks.&nbsp; It may also see changes in humanitarian policies with regards to minorities of any kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a sign full of contradictions, the Dog influenced year can be complicated and meeker signs may find themselves tapping into a plethora of emotions they may find uncomfortable, yet, empowering.&nbsp; Dogs also have a darker side but they aren&rsquo;t particularly afraid of it, in fact, they kind of love it.&nbsp; Hence, why, many explore the darker aspects of their characters.&nbsp; The key is moderation and not to impose any extreme puritanical ways upon oneself so that repressed feelings don&rsquo;t express themselves in strange ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the twelve signs, the dog is the guardian, so for those the dog favours, (ie the Rabbit, Horse, Tiger and Boar signs) they can expect to have an extended party of a year because the dog protects you from difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dog year has more than its fair share of serious issues, politically there may be revolts, rebellion and public humiliations as the Dog diligently hunts for the truth in order to serve justice.&nbsp; Many get their comeuppance as the Dog can be ruthlessly objective when called in to play judge.&nbsp; Despite the Dog&rsquo;s ability to be impartial and objective when they observe other people&rsquo;s circumstances, many still take things very personally.&nbsp; So expect people to be a tad touchier than usual too and it might be wise to have a mechanism in place to handle it when people to trigger you.&nbsp; This is a year to be bold and courageous, challenging yourself to challenge yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Rat:&nbsp;</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1912, 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Rats</strong><br />\r\nWilliam Shakespeare,&nbsp;Mark Zukerberg, Simon Fuller,<strong>&nbsp;Cameron Diaz</strong>, Ben Affleck, America Ferrera, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Marlon Brando, Mozart, Freddie Prinze Jnr., Yves St Laurent, Jennifer Garner, George Washington, Rebecca Romijn, Mandy Moore,&nbsp;<strong>Antonio Sabato Jnr.</strong>, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Jonny Lee Miller,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Dragons, Monkeys, Ox<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Horse</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the instigator, the fire starter, the beginning.

Through me you will see colors you have never seen before, experience delights you have never experienced before, I am the one who knows the way to Eden, follow me, I&rsquo;ll take you there. Gracious am I if you value my time, my voice and my contribution; be blind to my gifts and be blind to your own ignorance. I direct you to your own guidance, open you to your own intuition, lead you from the barren lands to the oasis because I know my world intimately; its structure, material and its effective usage. I should know, I was here before all else. I am the oldest sibling. I am the first born of the Chinese Zodiac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Rat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers</strong>: finance, medicine, law, science, politics and the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A complicated year lies ahead as you feel like you are on an unending treadmill. Just when you&rsquo;re done with one thing, something else will crop up and you will find yourself wasting precious time on petty unnecessary issues. You may find that superiors or people you respect may start criticizing your work more than usual or in a different, more intense manner that you may find offensive or hurtful. Don&rsquo;t take it personally and recognize that it&rsquo;s genuinely an attempt to push you to greater perfection. If you rise to the occasion, you will be rewarded, just don&rsquo;t take the route of indifference or reactive anger as the Dog rewards patience and perseverance, not revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Ox</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1913, 1925, 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Oxen:</strong><br />\r\nPrincess Diana,&nbsp;Margaret Thatcher, Meg Ryan, Bill Cosby, Michael Douglas, Kate Moss, Charlie Chaplin, Walt Disney, Napolean, Clark Gable, Robert Redford, Vincent Van Gogh, William Butler Yeats, Peter Sellers, Vanessa Redgrave, Dustin Hoffman,&nbsp;<strong>Aishwarya Rai</strong>, Barrack Obama, Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon, Peter Gabriel, Meryl Streep, James Marsden, Jim Carey,&nbsp;<strong>Dave Chappelle</strong>, Eddie Murphy,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Snake, Rooster, Rat<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Sheep</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the sturdy rock of the cycle, the immovable object, the monolith! The world is my charge and I alone am responsible for its improvement. Waking before dawn I graft until after sunset without uttering a word. My diligence is noticed and I am given increasingly greater responsibility as well as greater resources; now I set the rules; do as I say, but only do as I do when you stand in my shoes; you&rsquo;ll need unending resolve, military discipline and seductive charisma. My presence and humor cast an enchanting spell that makes me irresistible. The masses want to follow me, do what I ask and enjoy my dominance! I control my external world because I am but an alien in my emotional one, pretending that feelings don&rsquo;t exist doesn&rsquo;t work, so the emotional arena seems to be my steepest learning curve, but I&rsquo;m already halfway up the hill and as everyone knows I keep going until I reach my finish line: I either win, or I end. There is no alternative option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Ox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers:</strong>&nbsp;stand-up comedians, actors, carpenters, managers, mechanics, sculptors, teachers, architects, real estate and politics, gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may think that things are bleak and miserable, but they really aren&rsquo;t. The troubles you see and expect are all in the mind and you&rsquo;ll soon realise the sun is shining brightly on you. Things will be made easier for you and circumstances will allow a high degree of creativity at work. You&rsquo;ll find that people are being unusually co-operative and you will not need to use a heavy hand, in fact, avoid it, because it will spoil things. Money isn&rsquo;t great but has been worse recently so you can&rsquo;t really complain. Entertaining on a large scale may be required and an unexpected journey&nbsp;lead to entertaining adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Tiger</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1914, 1926, 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Tigers:</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong>, Tom Cruise,&nbsp;<strong>Leonardo Dicaprio</strong>, Ryan Phillipe, Joaquin Phoenix, Robbie Williams, Hilary Swank, Demi Moore, Alyson Hannigan, Natalie Imbruglia, Alanis Morrisette, Marilyn Monroe, Sheryl Crow, Jewel, Victoria Beckham, Stevie Wonder, Beethoven, Robert Pattinson, Usain Bolt, Ralph Fiennes, Elizabeth Banks, Jon Bon Jovi, Julie Walters, Lady Gaga, Hugh Hefner, Lindsay Lohan, Leah Michele, Dr Phil, Louise Hay, Bradley Cooper,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with</strong>: Horse, Dog, Boar<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Monkey</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am passion personified with more confidence than I can keep up with. Curiosity has nearly killed me a million times, but I&rsquo;m quick on my paws and love the thrill of the game. Calm on the surface, a storm on the inside; nobody understands the enigma that I am, I feel so much, I care so much, but I need my freedom even more! Wealth, status or fame, rarely impress me as these cat-eyes see bullshit for bullshit. Earn my respect, give me the truth and I&rsquo;ll infuse you with my energy, a rush of a trillion stars that flow from my veins into yours. I can fuel you when you&rsquo;re depleted, I can excite you when drabness threatens: my aliveness revives even the dead. As a feral cat, expect the unexpected, but also know that what I really want is to be tamed&hellip; actually, I&rsquo;ll never be tamed but I&rsquo;ll let you think I am. I&rsquo;m the impulsive, independent, improviser; the lone warrior, I trust myself and myself alone, even if I love you, I&rsquo;ll always be alone in my Tiger-ness, you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Tiger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Suitable careers:</strong>&nbsp;musicians, singer-songwriters, lawyers, dancers, sports, teachers, journalists, politicians, PR workers, military positions, and jobs within science and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dog creates an environment in which you flourish so you find yourself with all your buttons pressed on. &nbsp;This can lead to bouts of hyperactivity because of all the stimulation and excitement. &nbsp;The barriers come down and the world becomes your oyster. Career prospects sky rocket&nbsp;and your finances stabilise. &nbsp;Relationships mature and sone sort of rite of passage is possible. &nbsp;Of course, if this cat is still curious, it&rsquo;ll find itself embroiled in a few scrapes here and there but will escape with all nine lives intact; so when you play,&nbsp;play hard. Luck protects the Tiger folk this year, although still prone to the occasional&nbsp;bout of self-pity&nbsp;from imagined unpopularity, it&rsquo;s important to remember to put yourself out there as influential associates are waiting to lift you up. &nbsp;Active, creative and busy, decide now to make the following year (Boar year), your time time to rest and give this Dog year your all. &nbsp;It&rsquo;ll be more than worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Rabbit</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1915, 1927, 1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011, 2023</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Rabbits:</strong>&nbsp;David Beckham, Andy Murray, Whitney Houston,&nbsp;<strong>Angelina Jolie</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Brad Pitt</strong>, Johnny Depp, Robin Williams, Mike Myers, George Michael, Rodrigo Santoro, Blake Lively, ingrid Bergman, Tobey Maquire, Lauren Hill, Eva Longoria, Dermot Mulroney, Drew Barrymore, Lisa Kudrow, Ian McKellen, Kate Winslet, Eva Cassidy, Zac Effron,Tori Amos, Albert Einstein, Arthur Miller, Orson Welles, Quentin Tarantino, Sri Devi, Mel B, Emma Bunton, Zeenat Aman, Kangana Ranaut, Tina Turner, Nicholas Cage, Jane Seymour,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Sheep, Boar, Dog<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Rooster</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the sensual Casanova, the seductive siren and the political artist. With aristocratic manners and cultured flair I waltz through my world wanting to inspire greatness in others through my own amazing talents, yet hoping that nobody embarrasses me by highlighting my genius. It separates me from the mere mortals but I am one too and I see the greatness of being regular. But for some reason, this bunny is placed on a pedestal even though I am not the sort that likes to be paraded for the sakes of entertainment, well, not for too long anyway&hellip; I have real work to do. My art is my life and I do it to elevate consciousness to an unearthly plane, for some divine interruption, occasionally intervention for I bridge the real and surreal worlds. I am the psychic channel that communicates with spirit that is why the future flows from me. I just know that which is beyond psychology, beyond philosophy and beyond regular comprehension &ndash; I am of this world but my mind is beyond. Because I&rsquo;m noble, responsible and divinely beautiful, don&rsquo;t mistake me for an angel &ndash; I choose not to live up to anyone&rsquo;s expectations and will hop away in the blink of an eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Rabbit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the end of your opposite year, the Dog brings welcome comfort. Your nerves can relax as the Dog&rsquo;s influence is one you understand and can work with. Especially since this is the sign of your Soul Mate. It is a great time for romance and all things love. Be careful of getting too comfortable though as you may find there are a number of surprises that crop up, mostly positive and a few you probably saw coming but did not know how to manage. You may find yourself frustrated the behavior of superiors or peers, but don&rsquo;t lose heart, keep on keeping on and you will eventually reap the rewards you deserve. Generally, it is a relaxed year with no major problems and much to experience on an emotional level. Focusing on fun, lightness and your creative pursuits will place you in an ideal situation to let your natural beauty shine. You will find love showered upon you from all directions. Enjoy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Dragon</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1916, 1928, 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012, 2024,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Dragons:</strong>&nbsp;Calista Flockhart, Emma Stone, India Arie, Keanu Reeves,&nbsp;<strong>Sandra Bullock</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Bruce Lee</strong>, Sean William Scott, Reese Witherspoon, Courtney Cox Arquette, Rupert Grint, Lewis Carroll, Salvador Dali, Mae West, Sigmund Freud, John Lennon, Florence Nightingale, Alicia Silverstone, Patrick Stewart, Patrick Swayze, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexandra Burke, Adele, Jessie J, Wayne Dyer, David Icke, Colin Farrell, Benedict Cumberbatch, Joss Whedon, Roald Dahl, Josh Waitzkin, Martin Luther King Jr, Maya Angelou, Joseph Campbell, Shakira, Rihanna, Ryan Reynolds,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat, Monkey,&nbsp;Rooster<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Dog</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the spiritual messenger, the motivator, the mythical monster that channels the sun from within. All know I breathe fire, but what they know not, is that fire comes from a sun that burns in my belly, connects to the suns of the universe and amplifies my charge a million-fold. It is the source of my infinite power and functions on every plain, physical, mental, spiritual. I am a gift to mankind. I came to serve man&rsquo;s mind; to enthuse, to enliven and enlighten for I tread where no others can reach. I run, I climb and I fly. That is why I am beyond comprehension, sometimes even my own, but my inner sunshine god guides me to my next odyssey. Adventure to adventure I expand my experience, then I mirror it back to the world in shades they can see, in shapes they recognize, for I am the everyman in a beautiful beasts shell. I do not need to speak to impassion, my presence is enough, I do not need to touch, my presence is powerfully experienced, I do not need to take any action, my presence is every thing. I am nature&rsquo;s purest secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Dragon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year of the Dog favors the unprivileged and those who usually have to struggle to be seen or heard. Unfortunately, this is not you. In addition to this, the Dog is your opposite sign which means that this could be a tough year. You may notice that every six years you go through important changes, this usually happens in your own year of the Dragon and then its opposite sign of the Dog. These changes, although tough, are never beyond you and somehow you&rsquo;ll always derive a positive outcome from them. This is one of those years, so be prepared, don&rsquo;t rely on your presence or your luck to get you through. Call in friends or associates to handle the confrontations and remember to see the humour in the trying moments. &nbsp;You may find yourself having to function without your presence and regal powers so humble yourself and be prepared to be one of the civilians. It will not last for long, but while you&rsquo;re in the Dog year, tow the line and do not expect special treatment. &nbsp;That being said, there is always opportunities to be found within any obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Snake</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1917, 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, 2001, 2013, 2025,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Snakes:&nbsp;</strong>Sarah Jessica Parker, Sarah Michelle Gellar, James Van Der Beek, Kevin Williamson, Michael Fassbender, Linda Evangelista, Tim Ferriss, Liv Tyler, Cindy Lauper, Daniel Radcliffe, JK Rowling, Tom Welling,&nbsp;<strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, Iyanla Vansant, Barbara Walters, Lata Mangeshkar, John Malkovic, Taylor Swift, Peter Krause, Ronan Keeting, Samantha Morton, Ruby Wax, Brittany Murphy, Famke Jansen, Kanye West, Pierce Brosnan, , Tony Blair, Charles Darwin, Bob Dylan, Gandhi, Greta Garbot, John F Kennedy,&nbsp;<strong>Robert Downey Jr</strong>, Abraham Lincoln, Jacqueline Onassis, Pablo Picasso, Shania Twain, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan (actor), Dick Cheney, Chris Rock,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Ox, Rooster, Monkey<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Boar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the mentor, the political philosopher, the teacher. My life is my example to inspire you. My great ego endows me with power, influence and persuasive prowess but I must choose my path; for karma afflicts me powerfully and my deeds are read from the circumstances of my life. I am the mysterious strategist and there are only ladders for me to climb as I am the snake that can bring others down, or, if I choose, I can also be a ladder to support the growth of others. Though I am quiet, calm and wise, my anger, when released, creates earthquakes. Though my mystique is well acknowledged, my weakness is my need to be admired, seen as the ultimate sophisticated being. My words are sometimes tools and sometimes weapons, be my friend or my foe, you will be affected by my rhetoric. I breathe, I sweat and I bleed power &ndash; there is always more inside me than I release and I will never give it up until the time comes for me to shed my current skin and renew myself once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Snake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the Dog, many Snakes also have the vice of an addictive personality, so in a year where there are temptations all over, you must exercise your willpower in order to maintain your health. You can still have fun, but everything in moderation. The Dog lays out a mini adventure playground that you enjoy and it can really help to push you along in your current career path, but beware you don&rsquo;t get trapped. Sometimes things go missing for Snakes in Dog years but if you take this as a sign that the old is leaving encouraging the new and fresh to enter then that is exactly what you will invite. Let yourself indulge your interests this year, art, fashion and music are expected to be prolific so your involvement (in all ways) would be encouraged by the barking guardian. Generally, it&rsquo;s a productive year where you may entertain, be entertained and travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Horse</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1918, 1930, 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014, 2026,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous Horses: Katie Holmes, Cindy Crawford,&nbsp;<strong>Halle Berry</strong>, Annie Lennox, Rowan Atkinson, Angus Deaton, Joshua Jackson, David Schwimmer, Nelly Furtado, Emma Watson, Aaliyah, Aldous Huxley, Spike Milligan, Nelson Mandela, Paul McCartney, Tammy Wynette, Martina Macbride, Genghis Khan, Isaac Newton, Rembrandt, Theodore Roosevelt, Neil Armstrong, Barbara Striesand, Chris Everet, Sally Gunnal, Will Young, Gael Garcia Bernal,&nbsp;<strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong>, James Dean, John Travolta, Kristen Stewart</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Tiger, Dog, Sheep.<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the humanitarian rebel, the brave savior, the noble fighter. I am swift and agile and need space to roam. I crave freedom; therefore obtain it for others.&nbsp;&nbsp; With my external yang spirit and internal yin life, I present to the world an eternal contradiction, even though I maintain nature&rsquo;s perfect balance. I am 100% instinct! That is why I present such an inconsistent front. I require sole exploration. I want to know who I am without prior definition. I want to live life with blood coursing through my veins a million miles per hour because it suits me, because I know I&rsquo;m the only one who can handle it, because anything other than that is death. That is why I have this raw instinct, invisible antennae and reflexes: I was born with speed so I can live on the edge because that is where I belong! Pushing my own boundaries and that of society. If that pushes your buttons at the same time, deal with it! My job is to equalize the status quo, not make you comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the year that you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Every sign has one year where the fates bless you generously and for the horse, it&rsquo;s always the year of the dog. The air is softer, music sounds better and you find joy in everything. You may get a promotion, get noticed by influential people, make more money than you expect and have a blinding time during all of this. The dog creates an environment so attuned to your way of being that you can actually feel the changeover from the roosters strict, petty ways to the relaxed, laid back and fun environment that immediately begins at the end of January. You&rsquo;ve earned it. Enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Sheep</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1919, 1931, 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Sheep:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Julia Roberts</strong>, Pamela Anderson, Nicole Kidman, Mira Sorvino, Clare Danes, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Matt Le Blanc, Mena Suvari, Christina Ricci, Brandy, Guy Pierce, Heath Ledger, Andy Warhol, Sally Jesse Raphael, Billie Jean King, John Denver, Andrew Carnegie, Napoleon Hill,&nbsp;<strong>James Mcavoy</strong>, Michelangelo, Laurence Olivier, WH Auden, Nat King Cole, Thomas A Edison, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Chow Yun Fat, Madhuri Dixit, Juhi Chawla, Jamie Callum, Kurt Cobain, Kelsey Grammar, Sarah Mclachlan, Reba Macintyre, Harry Connick Jr, Jason Statham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rabbit, Boar, Horse<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Ox</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the social artist, the subconscious scientist, the compassionate innovator. My calmness, tender countenance and warmth invite all to love me. That is why I am often family favorite, the golden child, the chosen one. Though I may seem docile and malleable, I let you think what you want so that your needs are met and I can be free to be unconventional me. I experience the greatest&nbsp;<em>me</em>&nbsp;in my daydreams, for it extends the self in this tangible realm. I am not easily understood for what I understand is the un-understandable. I am the connection to subconscious worlds, to unknown realms and to divine plans. I feel it, I sense it and then I know it. I pull magic from my dreams and manifest it into tangible reality. I take my intuitive esotericism and add it to my emotional awareness to become the ultimate human behavior expert. Though I can be spoilt, frivolous and expensive, you will never feel more at home than when I am there, for I am&nbsp;<em>home</em>, I am comfort, I am your woolen security blanket&hellip; and I&rsquo;m worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Sheep!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a playground for others looks like a mine-field to you, but fear not dear fluffy Sheep, once you acclimatize, you will see it for the party it actually is. The biggest issue is that of fear, as the Dog challenges all to move onwards in their lives in a dramatic and powerful way. For you this may mean challenging the status quo in your romantic life, financial issues and family pressures. Conserve your energy and remain positive, as things are not as bad as they seem. More than any other year, you will be encouraged to put yourself first and prioritize your own needs. If you choose to put others first at this time, you may find that your good intentions might be taken advantage of and taken for granted. Do not make any long-term financial commitments or spend money on risky ventures. In this highly creative year, you may make headway towards a professional goal that you&rsquo;ve long been working towards. But make sure it is your vision. When in Rome, do as the Romans do&hellip; in the Dog year, put yourself first!</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Monkey</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1920, 1932, 1944, 1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, 2016, 2028</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Famous Monkeys:</strong>&nbsp;Jerry Hall, Giselle Bunchen, Lucy Lawless, Michael Douglas, Michael Schumacher, Roseanne Barr, Will Smith, Julia Sawalha, Brendan Fraser,&nbsp;<strong>Christina Aguilera</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Hugh Jackman,</strong>&nbsp;Justin Timberlake, Kim Catrall, Ashanti, Lord Byron, Charles Dickens, Julius Caesar, Winslow Homer, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonardo da Vinci, Bette Davis, Celine Dion</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rat, Dragon, Snake<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Tiger</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the most evolved of the cycle, I see the obvious and I turn it into comedic music, for I am the agile imp, the cheeky chimp, the naughty nymph. Naughtiness is present in my every gesture, my eyes wink without moving and I project sexiness without trying. But I am more than just a passing fancy, for within me is balance that all my astrological siblings lack; some may share my wit, attractiveness, a few have a presence I do not, but what they lack is a firm, grounded common sense and that I have in spades. I know what needs to be done and I do it, not because I feel it is the right thing to do, even I question my moral colors at times, but because I can see the results of the potential outcome if I do not take the action. It is not discipline that keeps me moving, it is my need for monkey motion and foresight. I want paradise for my own and I know what to do to get there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Monkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your flexibility and self-possession you excel because you plan to excel. &nbsp;Although,&nbsp;things might not always go the way you expect, it just pushes you to take matters more into your own hands. &nbsp;This self-reliance serves you well at this time and choosing better associates is also helpful. &nbsp;You may change your career this year and choose something you are personally connected&nbsp;to. &nbsp;You take the Dog influence in your stride and because of your fiery energy and fun personality, the Dog opens the doors to his home, lets you through the guarded gates into the party, so you can expect to have your fair share of fun too. &nbsp;Work hard, play hard and channel that Dog creative genius for your own projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Rooster</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Years:</strong>&nbsp;1921, 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous Roosters:&nbsp;<strong>Beyonce Knowles</strong>, Jay-Z, Sean &ldquo;Puff-Daddy&rdquo; Combs, David Boreanaz, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Natalie Portman, Catherine Zeta Jones, Dolly Parton, Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton, Joan Collins, Joan Rivers, Amy Schumer, Dawn French, Ellen Degeneres, Cate Blanchett, Rene Zellwegger, Gwen Steffani, Julia Stiles, Jason Priestley, Mathew Perry, Joss Groban, Amy Lou (Evanescence), Michael Caine, Josh Holloway,&nbsp;<strong>Roger Federer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Ox, Snake, Dragon<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Rabbit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the critical calculator, the cerebral conservative, the quality controller.

My head-comb is shines so bright, it can blind, my wings are perfectly brushed and my feathers are stunningly fanned! I have to look perfect so the world recognizes my superiority. I need to be &ldquo;on&rdquo; all of the time, I need to be available, I have to be perfect! When I am not happy, you will know, for I am a cocky, cocksure, cockerel.

The Dog allows you to recuperate and you are able to rebuild your position and authority. It&rsquo;s a good year for a new enterprise or new relationship. For most, one&rsquo;s own year marks the beginning of an official new cycle, however, the Rooster&rsquo;s sense of duty may have delayed such rebirth in the powerful way you would have wanted last year. Now your responsibility is over, you can allow yourself the luxury of putting your own needs first.

I was born cynical, suspicious and mature of mind, I get younger as I age. My mind flowers with youthful exuberance as I realize that I was never alone and that I did not need to be so strong. Forget 20/20, I have 50/50 crystal clarity. It frustrates me that the rest of the world lags so far behind; my creativity captivates the masses as I bore of my own edgy magic. My convictions are titanium. I need not external validation for I have greater inner resources. Many come to me for validation; oh how I pity those fools! But it is my duty to create a safety net for others and as I do, the heavens create a safety net for me! All are drawn to my beauty though some fear the feral creature hiding behind my eyes. Allow my doggy-drive to inspire you to the heavens for it is in my nature to uplift. Come to me for creativity, for guidelines, for magic and watch it manifest in my paws. I am the practical dreamer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Dog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to your Kingdom dear Dog. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible that the events of the previous Rooster year create a heaviness that you carry with you into your own year. &nbsp;However, there is a momentum the Rooster year provided which allows you to add a&nbsp;turbo boost to when the time is right. &nbsp;Setting priorities can wait, at the early part of the year, do what you need to and do it right. &nbsp;Your capacity to believe in your convictions despite external pressures and your copious amounts of courage will be your greatest asset. &nbsp;Things that seemed like impossibilities manifest. &nbsp;Ironically, you are more grounded than ever, yet, you&rsquo;ve never been more lost&nbsp;in your day-dreams. &nbsp;As a secret misanthrope, you are pleasantly surprised by the behaviours of others&nbsp;around you and their psychological elevation (part of which is caused by the influence of the Dog year) brings you comfort. &nbsp;Work goes well and you find increasingly more ways to be creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1><strong>Boar</strong></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Years:&nbsp;1935, 1947, 1959, 1971, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2019, 2031.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Harmony with:</strong>&nbsp;Rabbit, Sheep,&nbsp;Tiger<br />\r\n<strong>In Conflict with:</strong>&nbsp;Snake</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the capitalist, nature&rsquo;s raw sensualist, the baby of the astrological cycle. I am the completion of the cycle and the beginning, so within me is both the spiritual wisdom of my former maturity and the enthusiasm of this frisky fresh being. I am the sophisticating country child working to leave my humble beginnings behind. My past conditioning affects me with its heavy haze. Sometimes, I know not where I am or where I stand but am committed to figuring it out. Time is an enigma for I live partly in the past, partly in the present whilst tipping a trotter into the future for a peek. I live not for myself, but for my tribe. No role is beyond me, regardless of my gender, for my love comes without boundaries. This causes me much heartache and I learn to love with more discernment, leaving my self-sacrifice and martyr complex behind, I step into this sophisticated, compassionate and highly successful creature that everybody adores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the Boar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your Fortunes in 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dog has always felt like a big brother to you, so in this year, you will feel protected but you mustn&rsquo;t expect too much. You may still feel frustrated when things don&rsquo;t go your way and must recognize that it&rsquo;s due to your own previous choices. Also, some in the&nbsp;circles you walk in may find&nbsp;success earlier than you this year, which may cause a bit of bitterness; your biggest enemy though, is your overactive imagination which lowers your vibration if you let it. Stay positive always and choose what surrounds you based upon the way it feels, it&rsquo;s energetic composition. Opportunities to be creative and to have fun are plentiful and you have the potential to get a big&nbsp;idea that could be exceptionally fruitful&nbsp;in the future.</p>\r\n', 'astrology-ask-marilyn-advice-ftr-1-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-28 05:54:53'),
(112, 'Eating Mindfully', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'holistic-eating', '', '', '<p><em><strong>We all eat every day, and the food we choose can be a powerful influence on our wellbeing, health, energy and mood. How we eat is just as important. Mindful attention to the simple act of eating has the potential to transform your health significantly&nbsp;for the better. Eating mindfully promotes a healthy body weight, more conscious food choices, and healthier digestion. It also ensures optimum absorption of nutrients, optimum energy from what you eat, and increases self-awareness. | WORDS BY PHOEBE BOONKERD</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat slowly, chew food well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one food habit that you should adopt long term, this is the one it should be. Chew each mouthful to a liquid state before you swallow and put your eating utensils down between mouthfuls. This gives your digestive system a chance to communicate to your brain more effectively that you are full and also gives you a chance to listen to that signal, resulting in smaller portion intake.<br />\r\nWe are more likely to overeat when we gulp our food and do not chew. Proper chewing initiates digestive enzyme secretion, and increases the surface area of food, resulting in improved nutrient absorption and digestion. Try eating slowly, chewing each mouthful up to 20-40 times</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hara Hachi Bu to you!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a cultural habit &ndash; Eat until 80 Percent Full &ndash; practiced on the island of Okinawa, Japan, one of the world&rsquo;s most healthiest and long-living population groups. Studies show that those who practice Hara Hachi Bu consume 30% fewer calories than average, or who practice Hara Hachi Bu, actually age more slowly and live longer. This light under-eating at each meal also optimises digestion and reduces common symptoms such as gas, bloating, belching and other discomforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat well</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nourish your body with as many high quality foods you can afford or obtain. Your body is the vehicle in which you travel through life, and it deserves the best fuel so it serves you well into the future. The human body needs an abundance of plant foods, mostly vegetables as the dominant food group, supplemented by quality proteins, good fats and a smaller proportion of grains and root vegetables. Eat a rainbow of colour and variety of foods every day. This is the foundational principle of healthy eating and as a general philosophy, and as a lifestyle choice it is the golden rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Time your meals well, and always eat breakfast</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to start your day with a healthy breakfast &ndash; make time to savour and enjoy it &ndash; smoothies, juices, organic eggs, wholegrain porridges, grainy bread, avocado,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and fresh or sauteÌed vegetables are all great options. Overall, increasing the volume of vegetable intake in favour of carbohydrate staples (bread, rice, pasta), and maintaining a protein food at each meal supports balanced energy and a healthy body weight. Eat sensible sized portions approximately every 4 hours, allowing a healthy appetite for each meal. 3 meals plus an afternoon snack is a pattern that suits most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make sure there is a &lsquo;fast&rsquo; to break!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, make sure that the time between dinner and breakfast is a 12-hour fast. Digestion slows down at night, and we need fuel for the day. This simple fact means that the body is designed for a healthy, good-sized breakfast before 9am, a substantial lunch before 1pm, and a light dinner that finishes by 8pm for the body to renew, detoxify and rest as we sleep. It&rsquo;s best to stop eating 3 hours before sleeping. If your schedule is far away from this ideal, do what you can to gradually shift it. If you must eat late, vegetable soup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is recommended, as it is easy to digest, filling and less likely to burden your system, which promotes weight gain and &lsquo;morning fog&rsquo;. If you aren&rsquo;t hungry for breakfast, you probably ate too much, too late the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat to live, rather than live to eat</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy eating can be applied to what the Taoist philosophy calls &lsquo;going in two directions at once&rsquo;. This means, in one direction, focus on eating healthy food, get organised, sort out how you can logistically eat healthily, who is preparing it, to what recipes, and what you plan to eat, and then, and in the other direction, let food go a little, don&rsquo;t make it the main focus of your life. Eat mindfully in the act itself, and then get on with your daily tasks, forget about food for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avoid poor combinations or foods that burden your body</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have digestive problems, this is especially important, and you may get a lot of insight from a food and symptom diary. Fruits should be eaten alone, or before meals, never after, as this compromises digestion and encourages gas. Avoid drinking a lot of fluid</p>\r\n\r\n<p>with your meals as this also compromises digestion. Take notice the effects of the foods you eat, and avoid foods that you associate with discomfort or excessive fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food intolerance testing is very useful for ascertaining individual sensitivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about cravings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugar and carb cravings are a symptom of poor nutrition and fatigue. The intensity of cravings can be used as a barometer of how stressed, fatigued or poorly nourished you are. A more balanced eating plan can be of great assistance in preventing this. Sleep, emotional issues and stress are also essential to address and have a direct effect on cravings, eating patterns, and body weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How much is enough?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have slightly different needs in terms of portion sizes, but it is safe to say that many of us overeat routinely, which makes<br />\r\nus lose our sense of how much we should actually eat. To re-connect with this, one of the best techniques is to eat slowly. Another helpful technique is to use your own hand as a guide. This gives a good estimate, based on your body size:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PER MEAL:<br />\r\nProtein foods: the size and thickness of your own palm, or a handful of non-animal proteins such as beans and tofu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-starchy vegetables: 2-3 large handfuls (2 cooked, 3 raw)<br />\r\nCarb staples: as much as could t in your own cupped hand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fats: no more than your first three fingers- size portion of nuts or seeds or 1 tablespoon of cold pressed oil per meal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You are what you eat!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a plain fact! Eat lots of starch and simple sugars (bread, pastries, candy, chocolate, alcohol, potatoes, etc.) and you will become overweight (excess sugars in the body are converted into fatty acids which are stored as fat). Eat fried food and not only are you saturating your body, arteries and veins with gunk, but that gunk is in a free radical state. You&rsquo;ve heard of free radicals right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s what everybody&rsquo;s telling you to avoid</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>by taking anti-oxidants. Well even better, combine our with high heated Trans-fat oils (as in French fries, donuts, fritters, etc.) and you have a recipe for obesity, Diabetes, and chronic disease. YOU NEED to eat fruits and vegetable if you are going to be truly healthy. That&rsquo;s a fact! Learn to immerse yourself in the wonders of the plant kingdom. You&rsquo;ll glow for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat in peace</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating in stressful environments, such as over your keyboard, an argument or intense conversation, a TV show, in a mindless haze in the car, or when you are stressed or upset is hard on your digestive function and promotes digestive disturbance, overeating, too much of the wrong foods, guilt, and a bad relationship with food as a crutch for stressful emotions. Eat in a place where you can be calm, with minimal conversation of light topics, if any. Create a feeling of ceremony, with some aesthetically appealing table settings, bowls, and implements. Treat eating as an important act, and a chance to relax 3 times a day. Savour the moment, the environment,<br />\r\nthe company (even your own) and the flavours.</p>\r\n', 'Eating-mindfully-small-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 07:17:18'),

(114, 'Fertility Therapy with Hypnotherapy', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'mums-and-babies', '', '', '<p><em>The desire to have a baby can be so strong that a woman feels it like a physical pain but when there&rsquo;s no obvious reason for infertility, what can be done?&nbsp;</em><strong>Marica Josefina Atta</strong><em>&nbsp;believes hypnotherapy can provide solutions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to conceive when a baby is wanted so badly can leave many women devastated, wondering&nbsp;what&rsquo;s wrong with them.&nbsp;For some women getting pregnant&nbsp;becomes an obsession, something that preys on her mind 24/7. For other women it&rsquo;s a constant sadness and the sight of a baby or a pregnant woman can feel like a punch in the stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of how we react, failure to conceive rarely leaves us untouched and I believe it affects women at the very deepest level of their being. Unfortunately, fertility issues are on the rise and for modern women, it has become one of the major health and wellbeing issues of today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INCONCEIVABLE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s a physical reason with either the father or the mother that is behind an inability to conceive but in 25 per cent of all cases there&rsquo;s no obvious explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, whether there is a clear reason or not, what we do know is that our bodies always follow the mind. Every couple is unique; each person carries a history that has formed who they are today, this includes the life&nbsp;and mindset of ancestors, parents, childhood and lifestyle etc. We are largely a result of our past and what we choose to think, feel and do today will form who we become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every suggestion, thought or emotion that we entertain, has a corresponding physiological and chemical response within the body. Emotions gets transformed&nbsp;in the brain into biochemical&nbsp;and electrical messages, that are continuously released directly to the bloodstream and then transmitted to the hypothalamic/pituitary/ gonodal axis &ndash; which are responsible for reproduction. It makes sense therefore to pay attention to our thoughts and emotions when we&rsquo;re planning to conceive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FERTILE MINDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With HypnoBirthing Fertility&nbsp;Therapy, we&rsquo;re focused on fertility,&nbsp;not infertility, since our view is that<br />\r\nno woman or man is flawed, even&nbsp;in cases where a physical reason for&nbsp;no conception is detected. Just think<br />\r\nof the word &lsquo;fertility&rsquo; and see how&nbsp;it makes you feel, then repeat the&nbsp;word &lsquo;infertility&rsquo; and see how that makes you feel. We are all created to&nbsp;be fertile but since our bodies are a result of our mind and lifestyle, we&nbsp;can unconsciously block conception. As a therapist, I begin by looking at&nbsp;the mental and emotional level, where the root cause can be found through hypnosis tools to identify blocks or hindrances for a successful conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering a hypnotic state is just like daydreaming, it&rsquo;s a super-relaxed, altered state of awareness that allows us to access our subconscious mind in order to unblock and release emotions and old patterns as well as to connect with and influence certain parts of our bodies. In the fertility work, we also look at lifestyle and the physical health of the couple. We use a holistic approach so that the whole being becomes balanced allowing&nbsp;an overall improvement in life&nbsp;and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BABY MAKING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of how magically a hypnosis session can work is a client who came to see me to get help with anxiety. She and her husband had tried to conceive for more than a year&nbsp;without success. They had tried some medically assisted technology for conception but with no luck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the two sessions I worked with her, we didn&rsquo;t focus on fertility instead we focused on releasing tensions from her mind and body. She could hardly breathe when she first came to me, with a very stiff stomach, which means she didn&rsquo;t even receive her own breath. The more we started to unblock the deeper emotions she could breath deeply again and her body relaxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months later, she rang me to tell me she was six months pregnant and that she knew it was thanks to<br />\r\nour sessions. Of course every case&nbsp;is individual but sometimes our&nbsp;bodies respond quickly with just a few changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STRESS BOMB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s my job to detect what to unblock&nbsp;in couples experiencing infertility so that their bodies will allow conception. Thereby, there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;one-size fits-all&rsquo; solution when working with fertility but we do know that stress in all its forms, has a significant impact on fertility and this is a common element in the lives of modern women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too much stress plays havoc&nbsp;with our hormones, as well as our sleep, wellbeing, relationships, libido, immune system and digestion &ndash; all playing a crucial role in conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see a general state of inflammation in the bodies of people who are under constant stress for a long period of time. Stress manifests differently for everyone, so the individual seeking help should always be met with a customized approach. Stress doesn&rsquo;t only mean a hectic&nbsp;lifestyle, it can also be the result&nbsp;of emotional turbulence; a never- ending striving to perform, or never experiencing peace of mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandra Berga, MD, chair of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Emory University in Atlanta has reported several studies with findings that seemingly healthy women with fertility trouble tend to have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their blood. Emotional stress also reduces sperm counts in men. A study of 500 men published&nbsp;in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that sperm count dropped when&nbsp;a man&rsquo;s partner was going through In Vitro Fertilization, which is a difficult and anxiety-producing procedure. Another study published in the Journal of Reproduction and Infant Psychology found that couples were less likely&nbsp;to achieve pregnancy if the man was depressed and had low self-esteem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEMININE SUPPRESSION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another issue for women that I see every day in my job as a hypnotherapist and Theta healer is the suppression of naturally feminine traits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every human being is born with&nbsp;a mix of feminine and masculine&nbsp;energy. Feminine would be described<br />\r\nas the nurturing, open, sensitive, receiving part of us. Masculine is the directed, action-orientated, giving<br />\r\npart of us. Everyone&rsquo;s combination of these energies is individual but in the business/success orientated society that we have today, typically female traits&nbsp;are often considered weaknesses while masculine traits are strengths. Daily, women come to me for therapy who&nbsp;are subconsciously suppressing their feminine in order to fit into society, compete in the workplace, please family, etc. How is this related to conception? Conception is about receiving, which&nbsp;is a feminine trait. To receive a man,&nbsp;to receive love, to receive a life in your womb, to receive a baby into your&nbsp;life. Many of us are so accustomed to performing, giving and achieving that receiving make us feel guilty or uneasy. Suppression is always perceived as stress for our mind, whatever it is that we&rsquo;re suppressing. Since conception happens between two people, the state of the man, &lsquo;the giver&rsquo; in the case of conception, needs to be considered as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HYPNO FERTILITY THERAPY FAQ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. What is Hypnotherapy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering a hypnotic state is just like daydreaming, it&rsquo;s a super-relaxed, altered state of awareness that allows us to access our subconscious mind in order to unblock and release unhelpful emotions and old patterns as well as to connect with and influence certain parts of our bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. How does HypnoBirthing Fertility Therapy work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It typically takes four to six sessions but this can vary. It can be an effective aid and support for conception by itself or it can be used alongside In Vitro Fertilization and other Assisted Reproduction Technologies for a greater chance of success. The sessions are a combination of working with deep relaxation techniques, hypnotherapy, health care advising, breathing practice and conscious counseling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.hypnobirthingdubai.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>MARICA JOSEFINA ATTA is a certified Clinical HypnoTherapist, Theta Healer, HypnoBirthing pratictioner and Fertility Consultant.

Today, the two resorts are Barberyn Beach Resort and Barberyn Reef Resort. Together, they employ eight doctors and 52 therapists, comprising Ayurvedic physicians, therapists, dieticians and pharmacists, who treat patients with health issues&nbsp;of every kind including blood-related problems, arthritis, rheumatism, obesity and mental stress. But you don&rsquo;t need to have something wrong you to take time out at Baberyn, guests with no specific complaints also benefit from detoxing, de- stressing, and strengthening the immune system to improve general wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOOD AS MEDICINE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For my stay, I chose the Barberyn Reef Resort, located right on Beruwala Beach. I spent my week in a simple room with private terrace facing the ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On arrival, I was in need of rest and recovery. My first day began with an in-depth consultation with one of the resident Ayurvedic doctors and from this my dietary and treatment programme&nbsp;is set. I was asked questions like, &ldquo;What is your favorite season?&rdquo; &ldquo;How is your digestion?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you get angry easily?&rdquo; The answers gave my doctor a clear picture of my dominating &lsquo;dosha&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of Ayurvedic medicine is that health exists when there is a balance between three fundamental bodily energies or &lsquo;doshas&rsquo; called vata, pitta and kapha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ayurveda, food is complementary medicine and for me, no coffee, no wheat, no dairy and no meat are prescribed. I&rsquo;m also advised not to eat much cold food, and am served plenty of&nbsp;papaya juice and a tasty green soup with my meals.

(116, 'Causes and cures for eczema', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'mums-and-babies', '', '', '<p><em>The itching, the rashes, the redness, the scratching. Everyone who&rsquo;s had eczema knows those symptoms all too well. The cycle can be stressful and upsetting for sufferers &ndash; as well as for the parents of a child plagued with ezcema but there is a way out, writes&nbsp;<strong>Delphinia Tam-Lower</strong>&nbsp;of Four Cow Farm.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afew years ago in Queensland, Australia, there was a grandmother who wanted&nbsp;to make skin creams and balms for&nbsp;her grandchildren, one of whom had eczema. Also a midwife, she wanted to use time-tested and traditional recipes. From these small beginnings grew a business called Four Cow Farm. That ingenious grandmother is my mother- in-law and now our whole family is involved with producing a range of handcrafted, 100 per cent natural and organic skincare. Along the way, we&rsquo;ve become experts in the causes and cures of eczema and we&rsquo;ve devised this three-step guide to understanding and living with eczema whether you&rsquo;re age 0 or 90.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1: Understand what&rsquo;s happening under the skin of someone with eczema.<br />\r\nThe word &lsquo;eczema&rsquo; actually covers a very wide range of symptoms and conditions and many types of eczema exist. So, the best first step to take is to try and identify the type of eczema you or your child has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two broad groups of eczema &ndash; eczema that is triggered by direct skin contact with an irritant; and eczema that is caused by an increased sensitivity in the way a person&rsquo;s immune system reacts with their environment. The latter is known as atopic eczema and is the fastest growing type of eczema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A genetic twist of fate means that those with atopic eczema have skin that is unable to retain its own moisture (making&nbsp;it particularly prone to extreme dryness and itch) as well as particularly over-active immune systems that react to a variety of external influences (including the bacteria and yeast that live on all our skins).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2: Discover the key triggers (not as easy as you might think!) The next step is to begin whittling down the potential triggers of the symptoms&nbsp;&ndash; and there may be a few! An easy place to start is with the 3 &lsquo;E&rsquo;s of eczema:<br />\r\n(a) Edible &ndash; the most common trigger&nbsp;foods are cow&rsquo;s milk, eggs, soya,&nbsp;wheat, fish and nuts.<br />\r\n(b) Environmental &ndash; the most common&nbsp;culprits are clothing, harsh soaps and detergents, perfumes and preservatives in skincare products, fabric softeners,&nbsp;extreme temperatures, humidity, dust&nbsp;mites, pollen and pets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c) Emotional &ndash; strong emotions such&nbsp;as stress and anger may trigger a worsening of the symptoms, as well as illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best ways of identifying&nbsp;triggers is to remove them, one at a time, to see if the eczema improves. Four to six weeks per trigger is best for certainty so patience, patience, patience&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another approach is allergy testing which can be helpful if a specific allergy is suspected, though those with atopic eczema may test positive for none or many of the allergens tested. And all&nbsp;this will do is merely confirm that the form of eczema is atopic eczema (which, as described above, has its basis in the immune system), and not other forms of eczema whose main triggers are external.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wheretheprimarycauseofeczemais an external irritant, identifying the culprit or culprits will see an immediate and marked improvement in one&rsquo;s skin, or the disappearance of the eczema entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With atopic eczema, removing those key triggers will reduce the number of &lsquo;flare-ups&rsquo; which take place, but the dryness and itchiness is likely to continue for a while, and helping one&rsquo;s skin to cope with both on an ongoing basis will be absolutely crucial (we&rsquo;ll tackle this in the next section).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3: Put in place a very disciplined skincare regime (and we mean really disciplined!)<br />\r\nWith atopic eczema, the skin is unable to hold onto its own moisture. This consistent dryness is a primary trigger of itching, which can often lead to flare- ups, so helping the skin retain its own moisture is absolutely key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bath-time is a key time at which to protect the skin from loss of moisture. Sobeextremelycarefuland selective with shampoos, soaps and washes. Avoid products containing harsh synthetic detergents such as sodium lauryl/laureth sulphate or cocamidopropyl betaine and harsh preservatives such as phenoxyethanol or benzyl alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replenishing the skin&rsquo;s moisture is key. And dermatologists all agree that regular, repeated moisturising is crucial&nbsp;to managing eczema. By helping the skin maintain its moisture, we help maintain the health of the skin, and its ability to defend itself against external triggers and allergens. So if there&rsquo;s one mantra everyone needs to repeat when dealing with eczema, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;moisturise, moisturise, moisturise!&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For parents and carers of children with ezcema, help your child moisturise at regular intervals during the day. As you&rsquo;ll beapplyingyourchosenmoisturiservery, very often, make sure it&rsquo;s made from the very best natural ingredients. Skin with eczema is often thinner and more likely to absorb and react to the substances placed on it, so avoid anything containing synthetic nasties, artificial chemicals, added fragrances or petroleum derivatives (see the Four Cow Farm Guide on Baby Skincare for selecting safe skincare under &lsquo;Learn More&rsquo; on the FCF website).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more information, visit www.fourcowfarm.com/blog or email advice@fourcowfarm.com.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOUR COW FARM IN THE UAE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Four Cow Farm range of handcrafted, 100 per cent natural and organic skincare products are available</strong><strong>in Holland and Barrett stores throughout the UAE.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>The range includes Baby Lotion (125ml AED 53), Baby Wash (125ml AED 49), Calendula Remedy (50g AED 70), Tea Tree Remedy (50g AED 62), and more.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Not just for babies!

(118, 'How clean eating saved my life', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'holistic-eating', '', '', '<p><em>Clean eating guru&nbsp;<strong>Hannah Swanston</strong>&nbsp;knows first-hand how going all natural can transform health. Here she writes about how &lsquo;clean eating saved my life&rsquo;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I moved to Dubai in 2008. I was a carefree 20-something, thinking my fresh-faced glow and fast metabolism would forever be on my side. Partying non-stop with McDonald&rsquo;s on speed dial, I was also &lsquo;that&rsquo; girl who ordered a diet Coke with a burger meal, blindly swapping calories for chemicals. No stranger to the infamous &lsquo;Dubai Stone&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve tried every diet under the desert sun, which, while we&rsquo;re on the subject, I&rsquo;d lie under for hours on end; oiled up in the knowledge that my sun-drenched skin could be fixed with a quick shot of Botox. This was the 21st Century after all, in the fastest-growing city on Earth; there was always a solution. Nothing could beat me, or so I thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But my yo-yo-dieting-week-long-partying choices were damaging my health and within a few years, I was suffering from a long list of health issues, the least of my worries was the Dubai Stone (or two), I also&nbsp;had anxiety issues, skin pigmentation, and insomnia but worst of all was the aspartame poisoning from artificially-sweetened drinks. This resulted in me being rushed to hospital with Optic Neuritis, which left me blind for three months in my left eye. The party was officially over. Doctors said that if my lifestyle didn&rsquo;t change, I would lose my sight forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After researching natural ways to cure myself, I discovered the clean eating craze that was taking the world by storm. Not only did I heal my sight in three weeks but I unintentionally dropped about six kilos, and experienced a series of further mini-miracles, from curing my insomnia and anxiety, to transforming my hair, skin and nails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today, I leap out of bed and no longer need multiple layers of make-up, Botox, or an intravenous drip of caffeine to get me through the day. I exercise for two hours a day and hardly touch alcohol or food that doesn&rsquo;t have a natural source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For the first month, I went cold turkey, giving up meat, caffeine, alcohol, chemicals, processed foods, and anything that wasn&rsquo;t completely natural, whilst choosing&nbsp;organic where possible. Even pharmaceutical products were banned. No chemicals whatsoever were allowed near me. I also stopped having cosmetic treatments, including Botox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As the days, weeks and months progressed,&nbsp;I felt like a snake shedding layers of skin; as a lighter, happier, and more energetic version of myself appeared each morning; standing in front of the mirror a little more radiant each day. Within a very short amount of time, my skin was tighter, firmer, and brighter; and my clothes got looser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Once I felt I&rsquo;d flushed all the chemicals out, I began to re-introduce lean meats and a small amount of caffeine if I fancied it but I made a concerted effort to swap all items for healthier alternatives. Apart from processed foods and chemicals, which are still banned because of my health; I&rsquo;m more flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not perfect and I&rsquo;m never going to be. Sometimes, we just need that doughnut, glass of wine, or chocolate bar. The trick for me is to get right back on the healthy vibe the next day, and not to beat myself up about it. This isn&rsquo;t about being perfect, it&rsquo;s about good health, and finding a balance &ndash; whilst giving ourselves the flexibility to be human, and enjoy the finer things, guilt-free!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>HANNAH SWANSTON is a full-time writer who divides her time between London and Dubai.

(119, 'Food as sunscreen', 'eco&lifestyle', 'beauty', 'environment', '', '', '<p><em>Use nutrition not sunscreen to protect yourself against sunburn, cancer, and premature aging, writes organic cosmetologist&nbsp;<strong>Shirley Conlon</strong>&nbsp;who is no fan&nbsp;of the chemical-laden sunscreen creams.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, we&rsquo;ve increasingly been told to stay out of the sun to avoid skin cancer or to slather&nbsp;ourselves in sunscreen creams.&nbsp;But is the sun alone really the main&nbsp;culprit in causing skin cancer? Much research suggests that it&rsquo;s not. Many experts believe excessive sunshine, combined with bad lifestyle choices such as highly processed junk foods, caffeine, sugar, nicotine and sweetened fizzy drinks would have a different impact&nbsp;on the skin and could cause sunburn, premature ageing and increasing rates of&nbsp;skin cancer. The sun damages the skin through free radicals and anti-oxidants counteract free radicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the sun is also a major healing force responsible for sustaining all life on earth. Apart from being the most vital nutrient ever, the sun makes you feel good &ndash; just close your eyes and look in the direction of the sun for a couple of minutes (like a sunflower), and you instantly feel the regeneration and energy flow through your body, well, that is if you&rsquo;re not inside hiding from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should we be laying out in the full strength of the sun at midday? No, of course not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overexposure to ultraviolet radiation can be extremely damaging. In the same way that laying unprotected in snow in Antarctica will get you frostbite, over- exposure to sun will burn. As humans, there is a degree to which we need to protect ourselves from the elements but shrinking from the sun like vampires and slathering ourselves in the cocktail of laboratory-created chemicals found in a tube of sunscreen may not be the best solution and in fact may be doing more harm than good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most sun creams block the production of vitamin D and contain a host of carcinogenic ingredients that give a false sense of security by disabling the warning sign &lsquo;sunburn&rsquo; resulting in overexposure to radiation and cell damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some scientists now say that sunscreen may not prevent skin cancer at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VITAMIN D DEBACLE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the UAE is located in a desert yet many of its residents are vitamin D deficient is a pointer to how crazy our lifestyle and concerns have become. The best source of vitamin&nbsp;D is sunlight and studies have found that optimising vitamin D levels could actually help you to prevent at least 16 different types of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theories linking vitamin D deficiency to cancer have been confirmed in more than 200 studies. In fact, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute has published scientific research showing that sunlight exposure reduces the risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American academy of neurology confirms that vitamin D deficiency&nbsp;is associated with dementia and Alzheimers. And one case study in Italy suggests sun exposure improves the survival rate in melanoma patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Joseph Mercola, an alternative medicine practitioner and osteopathic&nbsp;physician, recommends not washing with soap for 48 hours after sun exposure (apart from necessary parts of the body) as chemical soap can rid the skin of vitamin D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOOD AS SUNSCREEN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do you build up your body&rsquo;s natural protection against sun damage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an interesting clue from history. The term &lsquo;Redneck&rsquo; comes from colonial times in the southern states of the USA. At the time, farmers lacked B vitamins (the result of not knowing how to treat their crops) and this B vitamin deficiency combined with long periods of sun exposure caused sunburn on the back of their necks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, your first line of defence against sunburn, cancer and premature aging, is consuming a diet high in vitamins and minerals &ndash; a type of edible sunblock, in other words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such good sun-protection foods include: carotenoid rich eggs, spirulina,&nbsp;chlorella, dark-leafy greens and yellow/ orange colours (apricots, cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash). The most potent carotenoid known is astaxanthin found in algae, salmon, trout, shrimp and lobster. Antioxidant rich berries, garlic, tomatoes, green tea, seeds, nuts and off course a good quality Omega 3 fish oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that moderate sun exposure is essential for good health, along with a balanced, antioxidant- rich diet of sun- ripened fruit and vegetables, and gives your body everything Mother Nature intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sensible. If you&rsquo;re going out in the sun, choose appropriate clothing, hats, and umbrellas and consider your skin type. Only on the rare occasions that I would be exposed for an entire day would I use a sunscreen &ndash; ideally a non-toxic brand. Use nutrition along with nature&rsquo;s plant oils to enjoy early morning or afternoon sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost all plant oils offer a degree of UV protection; raspberry leaf oil found in&nbsp;SCO Frangipani body oil contains NSPF (natural sun protection factor) of between 28-50 along with sesame, shea, macadamia and avocado with NSPFs between 2-10. Beta-carotene rich calendula, carrot and sea buckthorn all benefit sun-exposed skin. I apply SCO rosehip oil or hydrating serum and shea body butter on my skin but at the same time I am always careful of how long I spend in the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A $5 billion dollar a year industry has a vested interest in promoting the deadly effects of sun exposure from skin cancer to ageing, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder, if some large corporation figured out a way to charge us for sunshine, would it be then start to be marketed as the vital nutrient it actually is?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>SHIRLEY CONLON</strong>&nbsp;is the founder of Shirley Conlon Organics, a range of premium skincare products specially developed for hot climates using ethical, eco-friendly ingredients.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Email: shirley@shirleyconlonorganics.com.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>www.shirleyconlonorganics.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BEST BEAUTY BUYS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

In 2014,&nbsp;<strong>Natasha Tome</strong>&nbsp;was one of those visitors, here she describes the experience.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a small town in central rural Brazil, there lives a man of humble origins who has healed many thousands of&nbsp;people over the last 38 years from the Casa de Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. Now aged 73 (as of 2014), he&rsquo;s been visited by all and sundry, from the poorest in Brazil who travel over 30 hours by bus to see him, to the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Wayne Dwyer and Shirley MacLaine. While it may sound like a fairy tale, Medium Jo&atilde;o Teixeira de Faria, commonly known as Medium Jo&atilde;o, is a full trance medium that incorporates ascended beings of the light into his body for the healing of others. These beings of light were once incarnated as human doctors, surgeons, and healers and have now taken up the task to offer healing on earth during our lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I sit here in the serene and tranquil Casa garden writing this article, I reflect on my healing path and how it has brought me here to this tiny town in Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had been exploring energy healing modalities for years while living in Europe, Asia and the Middle East<br />\r\nwhen my path took me to Dubai-based healers Terri Allen and Buddy Abrahams (official Casa guides). They introduced me to a spiritual hospital in the Brazilian town of Abadi&acirc;nia where I could clear myself energetically of old emotions, hurts, anger, grief, resentment, as well as any physical ailments. Many believe that old stuck emotions can manifest into physical ailments and illnesses if left to fester. Something inside of me clicked when Terri explained the Casa to me and Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s work there. I wanted a clean, clear aura! I didn&rsquo;t want to carry emotional baggage with me for the rest of my life. Added to that was an annoying physical injury from a fall I had taken the year earlier. A left foot and right elbow that were stubbornly refusing to heal. I was ready, willing and able to experience my own divine healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MI CASA SU CASA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not necessary to go to the Casa with guides, it is recommended for first timers. I first went in August 2013 with Terri and Buddy as my guides and then on my own in July 2014. My first visit to the Casa healed me of my physical ailments so on the next visit I requested an emotional healing and clearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o is in attendance at the Casa from Wednesday to Friday so I arrived Tuesday afternoon at my Pousada (inn), a peaceful oasis painted in lilac and white, with an inner courtyard garden with fountain and koi pond. The rooms are basic but adequate and you get three meals per day. I nipped over to the Casa bookshop to buy a supply of bottled water blessed by the entities, which greatly assists with your healing. A quiet dinner and early to bed with excited anticipation of the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rising early to the sounds of crowing roosters and chirping birds, I joined the many other white-clad people walking to the Casa. The entities request that everyone wear white so that auras are easily seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were easily hundreds of white- clad people milling around waiting to see Medium Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated entity that day. I heard snatches of conversations in English, German, French, Italian and<br />\r\nof course Portuguese. After standing in the translation line to get my requests translated into Portuguese by a Casa volunteer (Medium Jo&atilde;o only speaks Portuguese), we then waited for our respective lines to be called. Lines for first timers, for repeat visitors, for interventions or revisions, every single person would be seen that day with remarkable organisation. There were people there in wheelchairs, on crutches, children, some&nbsp;sitting fervently in prayer, some laughing in the sunshine with friends, but all with a palpable vibe of hope and faith in the divine healing to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAINTS AND SOUP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Casa grounds, painted in sky blue and white as dictated years ago by its patron saint, Dom In&aacute;cio de Loyola. The grounds include a bookshop where you&rsquo;ll find several books on healing, healing crystals blessed by the entities, statues, photos, and even t-shirts and bags.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small caf&eacute; sells delicious Brazilian delicacies, fresh coconut water and juices and hot drinks. There are meditation grounds overlooking a beautiful vista of rolling hills and valleys. You feel far removed from the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world of worries and stresses while at the Casa. The soup kitchen at the Casa serves free healing soup to hundreds each day of the Casa operation and not far from there are the crystal bed rooms where you can sign up for 20 minute intervals on these healing chromotherapy beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also several places of prayer throughout, with triangles (the symbol of the Casa; representing faith, love and charity) for loved ones to place requests, pictures and prayers for those unable to travel to the Casa. The Entity will receive all requests from these triangles and bless them all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEETING THE MAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my line shuffled forward to Medium Jo&atilde;o sitting on his chair, we passed through the current rooms where volunteers sat for their own healing and also to help hold the energy for Jo&atilde;o and the incorporated Entity. He sat beside several four-foot high crystals emanating light. As I approached him, nervous, my heart in my throat, I remembered the guidance to look in his eyes as my translator spoke to Jo&atilde;o in rapid Portuguese with my requests. Jo&atilde;o took my hand in his soft hand and as I gazed into his eyes (blue that day, for they are known to change according to whichever Entity is incorporated), I felt he was looking inside me, to my soul, with such love and compassion. He gazed at me for mere seconds, which passed in a daze for me, and muttered something in Portuguese to my translator as he guided me by hand past him. Spiritual intervention that afternoon he&nbsp;had prescribed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each person&rsquo;s case is individual and&nbsp;the Entity might ask you to come back later in the day to visit with a different Entity who specialises in your specific issue, or you may be scheduled for a spiritual intervention, a session on the crystal bed, a visit to the sacred waterfall, passiflora herbs, meditation in the current, or whatever the divine deems you require at that moment in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I returned back that afternoon as requested at 2pm and the intervention line was the first one called. We were brought inside to a healing room to sit in meditation with eyes closed and our hands on our hearts or on the location of where you wanted the most healing. Casa volunteers explained that the entities can work on up to nine issues at once, all you had to do as you sat there was mentally ask. We sat quietly for about 45 minutes feeling waves of energy flowing through me and around me. Lost in my thoughts of what I wanted healed, I heard the deep tones of Medium Jo&atilde;o&rsquo;s voice in the room blessing us all and then we were escorted out for the briefing. This was my third spiritual intervention so I knew the drill of immediate bed rest for the next 24 hours, no sun, no physical exertion, and other requirements for the next eight days. First timers would have those restrictions for 40 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium Jo&atilde;o often says he can do 60 per cent of the healing work, and the rest is up to the individual so it was very important that we follow the guidelines given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BED REST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I lay in my room at the Pousada during my ordered 24-hour bed rest, I felt energy and pressure flowing and moving into and throughout my body. Through my abdomen, my head, my ears, my arms and legs. While I had requested healing for three specific issues, I felt the work being done throughout my whole body. Drifting in and out of sleep, at times having a good cry, journaling thoughts and emotions I was releasing, after the 24 hours was up, I felt cleaner, lighter, brighter and renewed. I felt like I was glowing from within. Physically I saw that my eyes were brighter, my skin fresher and smoother, and emotionally I felt like all emotions and thoughts that I&rsquo;d been holding onto that were not for my highest good had been pulled out of me and transmuted into nothingness. I was full of life plans and actions steps that I was eager to start on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day I headed early to the Casa to sit in the current room. While we sit there to help hold the energy and vibration for the divine healing work being done on our earthly plane, it is also a time when a phalange of entities work the room and heal those walking through, as well as those sitting there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After each current session, I felt amazing. My mood was uplifted, I felt love and compassion for everyone, I didn&rsquo;t judge and I felt benevolence for everyone and everything. I feel like I have had a profound spiritual awakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING &amp; EMOTIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On my last night in Abadi&acirc;nia, I spoke with an American woman at my Pousada who had come to Brazil with breast cancer. Diagnosed in September 2013, she did not want surgery nor radiation or chemotherapy. Her medical doctor called her daily advising her to get surgery or she will die. Instead she went to a naturopath who suggested it was an emotional block and perhaps she should go to Brazil to visit Medium Jo&atilde;o at the Casa. Two spiritual interventions later and another one during the night in her room, she told me she physically felt scalpels cutting into her breast, to her lymph node. She felt the pain, the heat, of work being done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many books written about Medium Jo&atilde;o and the successful healings he has orchestrated over the years but nothing can replace the awe of being at the Casa in person, feeling the energy, watching crutches being thrown aside as a person feebly makes their first unaided step, watching crying children immediately fall asleep after sipping blessed water while waiting in the lines, and just feeling the divine love and compassion pouring out of Medium Jo&atilde;o himself. A man who has devoted his life to being a vehicle of healing for others. As he often says, &ldquo;I do not cure anybody. God is the one who cures.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTACTS:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official website of the Casa<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.joaodedeusabadiania.com/\">www.joaodedeusabadiania.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubai-based Casa guides Terri and Buddy Abrahams<br />\r\nhttp://angelsoflightonline.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br />\r\nNATASHA TOME is an Atlantean Energy Healing practitioner and freelance writer based in Dubai, UAE.<br />\r\nEmail: natasha@whitelotuslight.com</p>\r\n', 'John-of-God-by-Cande-Salles-702x526-702x336.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:37:15');

Premium&nbsp;motors&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>and the environment might be odd bedfellows but in the world of motoring it&rsquo;s high-end cars like the Porsche 918 Spyder and the BMW i8 that are driving greener motoring technology.&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Adrian Maul</strong><em><strong>&nbsp;reports on green engineering in premium vehicles.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, the manufacturers of luxury supercars and high performance cars are spearheading much of the research and development that is resulting in more fuel-efficient vehicles on the world&rsquo;s roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of manufacturers have started to produce hybrid cars. This includes Porsche, BMW, Ferrari and McLaren. We&rsquo;re not saying all of these manufacturers are motivated by a desire to tread more lightly on the planet &ndash; what most of them are concerned about is building faster cars that use less fuel but this mission has a happy by product. All of these manufacturers are using hybrid technology and energy recovery systems to boost their efficiency and performance, and eventually this technology filters into standard production cars for the rest of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BMW i8</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C02 emissions: 49g/km</li>\r\n	<li>Fuel consumption: 2.1L/100km</li>\r\n	<li>All electric range: 37km</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>BMW have just released their new i8 in the UAE, not quite a supercar but very pretty and fairly quick all the same. BMW have gone a different route from most of the high end manufactures in that they have used a very small engine at 1.5l 3 cylinder in their hybrid offering coupled with twin turbo chargers. This is coupled to a 96kW motor to give a combined power of over 350 bhp. This is also a plug-in hybrid and battery life is preserved using brake energy regeneration technology to top up the battery whilst braking and coasting. This car can accelerate from 0 to 100 kmh in 4.4s, has CO2 emission of just 49g/km and an impressive fuel consumption of 2.1l/100km. The all electric range for this car is 37km. BMW have pulled out the stops here and produced a car that I think is beautiful to look at, is plenty fast enough and has stunning eco friendly statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Porsche 918 Spyder</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C02 emissions: 79g/km</li>\r\n	<li>Fuel consumption: 3L/100km</li>\r\n	<li>All electric range: 29km</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Porsche have been making modern hybrid cars for a few years now, and the hybrid Panamera S has been featured in previous issues of this magazine for its eco-friendly statistics. The hybrid Panamera S has a new sibling though, the 918 Spyder, a hybrid supercar with a 4.6l V8 engine combined with a 115kW electric motor. Lets face it though, this is a supercar and the technology in this car is primarily there to make it go faster, the upside of this is that as a result it is also easier on the environment due to its lightness plus the fact that it uses plug-in hybrid technology and energy recovery systems. The statistics for this car are 0-100 kmh in 2.6s, CO2 emissions of 79g/km, average fuel consumption of 3l/100km and an all electric range of 29km. This car also currently has the record as the third fastest lap time for a production car at the Nurburgring race track of six minutes 57 seconds, beaten only by two variants of the Radical SR8 British sports car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>McLaren P1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C02 emissions: 194g/km</li>\r\n	<li>Fuel consumption: 6.9L/100km</li>\r\n	<li>All electric range: None</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The all new McLaren P1 was described by Jeremy Clarkson on motoring television show Top Gear UK as a &ldquo;game changer&rdquo; due to the way that it uses technology to boost its performance. The P1 has a 3.8l twin turbocharged V8 engine coupled to a 131kW electric motor to give a combined power output of 903 bhp. It uses similar technology to the other cars here using extremely lightweight materials in its construction; the windscreen is only 3.2mm thick and made of acrylic which repels water meaning it does not require the weight or drag of windscreen wipers. The energy recovery system in the P1 is called Instant Power Access System (IPAS) and is capable of giving twice the power that the old F1 KERS system produced, and all packaged in an extremely light 26kg electric motor. So Mclaren brings lightness technology seriously to the table, its statistics are fairly good too with 0 to 100km of 2.8 seconds, slower than the Porsche 918 but it is faster to 200 kmh than it, CO2 emissions of 194 g/km and fuel consumption of 6.9l/100km.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>LaFerrari</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green stats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>C02 emissions: 330g/km</li>\r\n	<li>Fuel consumption: 14.2L/100km</li>\r\n	<li>All electric range: None</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Ferrari have brought their LaFerrari offering to the table. This is all supercar and has no pretentions of trying to help the environment. A 6.3l V12 engine is coupled with a 120kW motor produces a staggering combined power of 950 bhp. This car uses all of its technology for power and speed and therefore does not perform nearly as well as the other offerings on the environmental side, its electric motor is purely a device to boost the power delivered to the wheels, and it has no capability to drive solely with its electric motor. It accelerates from 0 to 100 kmh in under three seconds, has CO2 emissions of 330g/km, fuel consumption of 14.2l/100km and an all electric range of 0km. The technology in this car should not be discounted though as it uses energy recovery technology, and the technology of using an electric motor to boost power can be used by other manufacturers to reduce engine size subsequently reducing consumption and emissions figures for their cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These cars are outside of the pay packets for most of us, and most are not particularly eco friendly either. What we need to remember though is that they are bringing to the table technology that will be used in time for everyday production cars. The eco statistics for the Porsche and BMW are exceptionally impressive and would be in cars with only a fraction of their performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECO-MOTORING NEWS</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bentley goes electric</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2017, Bentley plans to be joining the hybrid club with its first plug-in hybrid model, a dedicated version of the all-new SUV.

(122, 'Mindfulness meditation as medication', 'eco&lifestyle', 'eco & lifestyle', '', '', '', '<p><strong><em>Even most traditional doctors in the UK now believe their patients could improve their health with meditation. Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D. Griffiths of the Psychological Wellbeing and Metal Health Research Unit of the UK&rsquo;s Nottingham Trent University report on meditation as medication.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recently, it was practically unheard of that doctors and other front-line health professionals would even consider prescribing their patients&rsquo; meditation rather than medication. However, according to a report by the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Mental Health Foundation,&nbsp;</em>72 per cent of general practitioners in the UK now believe that patients can improve their health by practising meditation. The most popular meditation technique to be used in research and healthcare settings is mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is the practice of cultivating a full and open awareness of the present moment. Research has shown that we have a tendency to not be &lsquo;fully present&rsquo; and this can sometimes leave us feeling that life is racing by too fast. If we spend most of our time dwelling on the past and/or trying to rush towards the future, then we miss out on what is happening &lsquo;here and now&rsquo;. Given that the past is history, and the future is fantasy, the present moment is the only place where we can truly experience and appreciate the wonders of life. So how do we introduce mindfulness into our daily lives and make sure that we stay in touch with the present moment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mindfulness explained</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindfulness has been used by Buddhist practitioners for over 2,500 years. Although you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that &lsquo;mindfulness&rsquo; means that we should be &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo;, this doesn&rsquo;t quite capture the essence of mindfulness practice. Being &lsquo;full of mind&rsquo; basically means that there is a lot of mental exertion (as well as a lot of brain noise and chatter). Having a &lsquo;full up&rsquo; mind all of the time can be stressful and tiring and it doesn&rsquo;t leave room for wholesome thoughts to grow and flourish. Mindfulness helps to create space in the mind so that we can observe and nourish our being more fully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life is an extraordinarily rare and fragile gift. If we are fortunate, it may last for 100 years. Each and every moment contained within those 100 years is profoundly unique. Nobody else will experience that moment and it will never arise again. It was born, it lived, and it died &ndash; gone forever. If we are not fully aware of all that we see, hear, smell, taste, and touch in each and every moment then maybe we have to conclude that we are not fully alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pali word for mindfulness is&nbsp;&lsquo;<em>sati&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>which means &lsquo;<em>to remember</em>&rsquo; &ndash; in the sense that we should remember to be aware of all that we experience in the present moment. Given the present moment is made up of countless happenings and occurrences, the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness outline four key areas that can be used as focus points for our concentration: (i) the body (starting with the breath), (ii) feelings, (iii) thoughts and mental processes, and (iv) the environment around us. Basically then, the best way to practice mindfulness is to start by becoming aware of our breathing, then expand our meditative awareness to encompass the body, then feelings and thoughts, and finally the environment in which we find ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The health benefits of mindfulness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research studies have shown that over 80 per cent of British adults believe that modern-day pressured lifestyles lead to stress and illness and that their health can be improved by slowing down and learning to be mindful of the present moment. According to the latest research findings, mindfulness meditation can be beneficial for improving a wide variety of health conditions including stress, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, eating disorders, and even problems relating to sexual performance. In fact, some forms of mindfulness meditation are now recommended by the&nbsp;<em>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&nbsp;</em>for the treatment of specific types of depression. In addition to its medical benefits, scientific research has also shown that mindfulness can improve intellectual functioning and memory capacity &ndash; including in school-age children. Engaging in mindfulness regularly has also been shown to improve people&rsquo;s spiritual wellbeing as well as their overall sense of purpose in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five tips for practising mindfulness effectively</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Adopt a suitable meditation posture</em>: The first thing to think about when starting to practice mindfulness meditation is to adopt a suitable meditation posture. The most important things to keep in mind are that your posture is stable and that you are comfortable (because a good physical posture leads to a good mental posture). Some people prefer to sit cross-legged on a meditation cushion whilst others prefer sitting upright on a chair. It&rsquo;s simply a matter of personal preference &ndash; either position can work well. In an eight-week group mindfulness program we developed called Meditation Awareness Training (MAT), the analogy of a mountain is used to help participants understand the most appropriate posture for meditation. A mountain has a definite presence, it is upright and stable, yet at the same time it is without tension and does not have to strain to maintain its posture &ndash; it is relaxed, content, and deeply-rooted in the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Follow the breath</em>: As part of mindfulness practice, observing the breath is used as a kind of &lsquo;meditative anchor&rsquo; to help with concentration and with maintaining an open-awareness of the present moment. Being fully aware of the in-breath and out-breath helps to &lsquo;tie the mind&rsquo; to the present moment and to slow down our thought processes. If you&rsquo;re somebody who has difficulty concentrating, then try counting the breath from one to ten, and then back to one. Similarly, you might find it helpful to quietly guide yourself with phrases such as &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am fully aware of my in-breath; breathing out, I am fully aware of my out-breath</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>breathing in, I am here; breathing out, I am now</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>breathing in, there is nowhere I need to be; breathing out, I am already home</em>&rdquo;. One thing to remember when following the breath during meditation is that it is very important not to force your breathing &ndash; just let the breath follow its natural course and allow it to calm and deepen on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Carry your meditation cushion with you</em>: Just as conditions such as the sun, rain, and nutrients are required for a seed to grow into a blossoming flower, meditative development requires us to make the &lsquo;right effort&rsquo; at all times. Sometimes people try to cram in their mindfulness practice with all of the other activities of their lives and they make the excuse that they don&rsquo;t have time to practice. However, this approach often leads to a stressful attitude towards mindfulness and for some people the practice can quickly start to become a chore. Therefore, the trick is to not create a separation between your mindfulness practice and the rest of your life. In fact, it&rsquo;s when you blow out your candles and stand up from your meditation cushion (or chair) that the practice of mindfulness really begins. While sitting or writing at the computer, tidying-up at home, cooking the dinner, or doing the weekly food shop, do your best to be mindful and to remember to observe your breathing. Real meditators are those who can practice &lsquo;on the job&rsquo; and this is why some meditation teachers tell their students to carry their meditation cushions with them at all times. Try not to battle with yourself &ndash; make the present moment your home and simply bring your awareness to whatever you are doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Make use of mindfulness reminders</em>: Based on our own experience of teaching and researching MAT, those that best manage to integrate their mindfulness practice into everyday life tend to be the ones who show the greatest improvements in overall levels of psychological and spiritual wellbeing. One helpful way of maintaining mindfulness during everyday activities is to use &lsquo;<em>mindfulness reminders</em>&rsquo;. An example of a mindfulness reminder is an hour chime (e.g., from a wrist-watch or desktop computer), that, upon sounding, can be used as a trigger to gently bring the mind back to the present moment and to the natural flow of the in-breath and out-breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Have realistic expectations and keep practicing:</em>&nbsp;Finally &ndash; as with many things in life &ndash; it is not uncommon for people to begin practising mindfulness enthusiastically, but then give up as soon as a minor difficulty is encountered. One reason why some people don&rsquo;t stick at their practice is because they have unrealistic expectations. Mindfulness is not a quick-fix solution. Long-lasting spiritual and personal growth require perseverance and a great deal of practice. Thinking that mindfulness meditation can immediately solve all of your problems or change your life overnight is a mistake. However, just as all effects follow a cause, the day-in day-out integrating of all aspects of your life with present-moment awareness will gradually begin to soften the conditioned mind and &ndash; over time &ndash; allow rays of tranquillity and insight to slowly break through. When correctly practiced, mindfulness is extremely hard work and requires us to be patient and compassionate with ourselves. However, mindfulness also requires us to thoroughly enjoy life no matter what situation we find ourselves in. The practice of accepting and getting to know our mind and true selves during mindfulness meditation &ndash; including those parts of our character that we&rsquo;d sometimes prefer didn&rsquo;t exist &ndash; can be really hard work, but it should also be a lot of fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The authors of this article are Edo Shonin, William Van Gordon, and Mark D.

Gardening saves you money, provides organic food, is a meditative practise, and great for involving children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start Small, Grow Big</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While gardening can seem intimidating to the newcomer, there are plants that are very forgiving to the novice gardener, including cherry tomatoes, mint and other green herbs as well as the hardy aloe vera.&nbsp; As veteran balcony gardener Smitha Lobo-Mascarenhas put it, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill a mint!&rdquo;&nbsp; Smitha, who has over 75 small and large plants on her 3.5m x 1.5m balcony in Karama, recommends starting out with kitchen herbs such as the hardy mint, fenugreek, coriander as well as onions, garlic and curry leaf.&nbsp; Scouring the produce section of local stores like Choithrams and Lulu, Smitha is constantly on the lookout for ginger, lemongrass, garlic, beetroot and the like that are sprouting.&nbsp; She recommends using the sprouting plants as an easy and inexpensive way to get starter plants&nbsp; for your balcony garden.&nbsp; Spices such as coriander and fenugreek &ndash; found in the spice aisle of your local supermarket &ndash; can also be made to sprout to produce seedlings for your own kitchen herbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Allais-Mar&eacute;, founder of the Balcony and Urban Gardening in the UAE group, advocates keeping your gardening &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; &ndash; by which she means reusing existing containers (like yoghurt cups and water bottles for sprouting seeds) and inexpensive potting soil mixtures (see sidebar &lsquo;Laura&rsquo;s Magic Potting Soil Mix&rsquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;My garden may not be elegant,&rdquo; Laura says, &ldquo;because so many of my plants are growing in re-purposed yoghurt cups, but the plants are beautiful<em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Passionately committed to growing good food and fostering awareness of the connection between the earth, people and food, Laura established the balcony gardening group upon her arrival in the UAE in 2013.&nbsp; The group now has nearly 300 gardener members, roughly split between experienced and new gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How and When to Start Your Balcony/Patio Garden &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With temperate winter months and scorching summers, Dubai&rsquo;s optimal growiing&nbsp; season starts in October/November, with plants thriving on patios and balconies January-early April.&nbsp; Karteeka Tayyagi, a balcony gardener for the past eight years, recommends starting with soil preparation in October/November.&nbsp; She suggests cleaning the pots/containers with a mild cleaning solution and drying them in the sun to kill any molds/funghi or other pathogens left from the previous growing season.&nbsp; Karteeka mixes her old soil with fresh potting soil, chicken manure pellets, humus and red sand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Karteeka and Smitha encourage beginners to work with seedlings or plants you already know before moving on to more exotic (and usually more expensive) plants.&nbsp; Karteeka recommends sprouting seeds indoors and repotting seedlings when the plant grows three sets of leaves.&nbsp; After seedlings are repotted, you can move them to your balcony or patio &ndash; paying close attention to wind and sun conditions.&nbsp; Morning sun, per Smitha&rsquo;s experience here in Dubai, is best for young plants and most varities, as afternoon sun can be very harsh.&nbsp; Karteeka cites strong winds &ndash; as often come to high-rise balconies in areas like JLT or Old Town &ndash; as big challenges for balcony gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the plants grow and reach maturity, you can begin to harvest the herbs, vegetables and fruit you&rsquo;ve planted.&nbsp; Many herbs thrive on multiple cuttings &ndash; especially mint &mdash; while some veggies must be harvested at a particular time.&nbsp; As any devoted gardener will tell you, seeds are essential to maintaining your future stock of plants &ndash; so invest in quality, organic and non-GMO seeds to ensure the best possible variety of plants and to maintain biodiversity and heirloom varieties.&nbsp; As the summer months approach, it is time to&nbsp; cull the spent plants and move those that won&rsquo;t survive the outdoor heat.&nbsp; Collect the soil from your containers and store in sealed plastic containers until the next growing season.&nbsp; (Microwaving soil is a great way to kill pathogens and return it to a soft texture, recommends Karteeka.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The keys to successful container gardening &ndash; either on your patio or balcony &ndash; comes down to a few essentials:&nbsp; appropriate amount/strength of sunlight, proper watering, pruning and love for your garden. The most common mistakes new gardeners make?&nbsp; Over-watering their plants and not being patient enough with their plants.&nbsp; Many varieties need plenty of time for their seeds to sprout and seedlings to grow; give your plants time and you&rsquo;ll harvest the rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Balcony and Urban Gardening in the UAE group meets once a month to swap seeds and seedlings, exchange tips and socialise; you can join this group to gain a valuable network of gardening gurus adept at creating bountiful, beautiful gardens in small spaces here in the UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where to get your gardening stuff</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warsan Nurseries &ndash; past Dragon Mart &ndash; is a large collection of nurseries staffed by very experienced nursery staff who can help you with seedlings, plants, soil, pots and more.&nbsp; Blue Planet Green People in JLT is another great source of organic seeds and gardening supplies.&nbsp; You can also create your own compost for your soil and collect your own seeds from the organic produce available at several organic shops and markets in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plants for your summer balcony or patio</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With some good old TLC (tender, loving care), attention and proper watering, some varieties of plants do well &ndash; and actually thrive &ndash; in the intense UAE summer months on balconies and patios. Give these ones a try: Bougainvillea, Desert Rose (Adenium), Aloe Vera, Ixora, Mint, Jade Plant, Curry Leaf Plant (Murraya koenigii).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expert Tips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 1:&nbsp; Black pots will get extremely hot in the summer, so make sure you repot all of your plants into non-black pots.&nbsp; Plastic pots are better for plants outdoors in the summer as they retain water better than porous clay pots but each type of plant will have its specific requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 2:&nbsp; Some plants have highly toxic parts.&nbsp; All parts of the Desert Rose and Oleander, for example, are highly toxic, so keep children and pets away from these plants.&nbsp; When in doubt, check for potential toxicity before adding new plants to your garden, if you have young children or inquisitive pets at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 3:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t water your plants in direct sun!&nbsp; Especially during the summer months because the wet leaves can actually burn and turn brown if wetted in direct, intense sunlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Laura&rsquo;s Magic Potting Soil Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&bull; 60-70 per cent red desert sand (from interior desert, not the beach)</li>\r\n	<li>&bull; 25-35 per cent potting soil</li>\r\n	<li>&bull; 5-10 per cent&nbsp; organic material (chicken manure pellets, compost, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of sustainability, don&rsquo;t use peat.&nbsp; A non-renewable resource, peat is an ancient form of soil found only in limited parts of the world. Peat harvesting has had devastating ecological impact on the local biosphere.&nbsp; Some local gardeners use &lsquo;coconut peat&rsquo; (aka coconut coir) as a mulch or component in your potting soil to help retain moisture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Great gardening resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are literally thousands of gardening websites, videos and social media groups online.

(125, 'Beauty products in your kitchen', 'eco&lifestyle', 'eco & lifestyle', 'environment', '', '', '<p>Toxin-free, natural homemade skincare is often overlooked yet produces fantastic results. By&nbsp;Sarah Bladen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toxic&nbsp;products exist almost everywhere &ndash; from supermarkets to department stores &ndash; and in bright, shiny packaging, looks can be deceiving. Despite seductive advertising, some of these well-known brands contain harmful chemicals (like parabens and petrochemicals) proven to be carcinogenic. But as consumers we have a choice as to what we put on our skin (so by default into our bloodstream and through our organs) and many safer alternatives without the hefty price tag, are overlooked. What you may not know is that you can find some of the best beauty products in your kitchen. That&rsquo;s right, you don&rsquo;t need to look further than your pantry to find an effective tried and tested remedy that has worked well for centuries. Not only do you save money with these eco-friendly options, they are also good for you. After all, they are edible. As well as doubling up as skincare, the natural wonders below can also be used for medicinal purposes. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WhAT: LemON JuIce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly a beauty wonder, lemon juice can fade age spots, freckles, and combat acne. It&rsquo;s also a natural facial &lsquo;peel&rsquo; and a super cheap way to get hair highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skincare:&nbsp;using lemon juice on&nbsp;your face helps to tighten and shrink pores, fight acne and fade freckles and pigmentation. Got a pimple? Dab a drop of lemon juice on it when you go &nbsp;to bed at night &ndash; the L-ascorbic acid in lemons is the active ingredient in many commercial acne products. If you&rsquo;re after a lighter complexion or want to fade pigmentation, the citric acid in lemons can whiten, brighten and lighten your skin. Squeeze the juice of a lemon or two into a little bowl then, with a cotton ball, apply to your pigmented areas and leave it on for up to 10 minutes before thoroughly rinsing with cool water. For best results, exfoliate first. mix a pinch of sugar or sea salt with the lemon juice. Some people do this daily; for other people that&rsquo;s too often. Initially, try every second day to gauge how your skin reacts. Like any bleaching or fading cream, lemon juice only works with regular use and results are gradual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re after some subtle highlights in your hair, lemon juice is also the way to go. One method is to combine lemon juice and hair conditioner, comb through your hair and sit in the sun before washing out. Repeat at least once a week for significantly lighter hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warnings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w Like any depigmentation treatment, lemon juice will make your skin more sensitive to ultraviolet rays so be extra vigilant with sunscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w If you&rsquo;ve got dry skin, undiluted lemon juice can exacerbate the condition so mix equal quantities of water and lemon juice in a little spray bottle. Just watch out for cuts, lemon juice can sting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>w Be careful if you&rsquo;re already using other topical medical treatments, the lemon juice may not be a good combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinal Benefits:&nbsp;First thing in&nbsp;the morning, one of the best ways to detox your body is by drinking a tall glass of water with freshly squeezed lemon. Once in the body, lemon juice acts as an alkaliser, restoring your Ph levels and boosting your immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more tips and natural lemon juice beauty recipes, check out&nbsp;www.newhealthguide.org&nbsp;and&nbsp;www.livestrong.com.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT: APPLE CIDER VINEGAR<br />\r\nThis has been used as folk medicine for eons and with good reason.

If you have sensitive skin, use five tablespoons of water to a tablespoon of AcV. As your skin gets comfortable with it, you can go down to two or even one tablespoon of water. either leave on for 10 minutes and rinse or apply face oil over the top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned about how your skin will react, first apply the diluted AcV to your wrist and leave it an hour to check for any redness or irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For an all over body treatment, add a cup of apple cider vinegar and a cup of epsom salts to a hot bath to draw toxins out through the skin and help jumpstart the cleansing process.

(126, 'Paint away your problems: The power of art as therapy', 'eco&lifestyle', 'eco & lifestyle', '', '', '', '<p>Creative expression has the power to change your life, writes&nbsp;Jan D&rsquo;Sa,&nbsp;a molecular biologist-turned- artist who discovered this for herself after picking up her paintbrush saved her life and sanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative&nbsp;expression is a powerful tool for healing, meditation and de-stressing. With more people opting for alternative paths to health, wellness and happiness, expressing yourself creatively &ndash; be this anything from art, to woodwork, dance, cooking or making model aeroplanes &ndash; is an effective tool for rebalancing and releasing stress or pent-up emotion. Yet, increasingly creative expression is taking a back seat to social media. The technology available at our fingertips makes it difficult to tune out the Facebook feeds, Twitter alerts or photo galleries on Pinterest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As creative beings, we need outlets to express ourselves and nurture our inner selves. It does us no good to choke the pipelines of our creative souls by letting distractions of the outer world take over our lives. Living life without creative expression leaves us feeling repressed and robotic. From here, the inner darkness can manifest as illness and the depression that destroys relationships with ourselves and with others. I know this from personal experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, I repressed my creativity to the point of disowning it completely. As an adult third culture kid, I was faced with the perennial &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t fit in because I do not belong anywhere&rsquo; imbroglio. Added to that was the criticism from business peers who couldn&rsquo;t understand how a molecular biologist like me could also be artistic. So I shut down my creative side to survive in the corporate world of engineering and medicine. My shackled creative being, relegated to the dark corners of the universe, kept calling for attention and expression but I refused to listen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For 10 years, I blocked my creativity and denied my emotions. As a result I hit rock bottom and this was the impetus I needed to resurrect the imprisoned creative self. That&rsquo;s when I bought some art paper and pastels, sat on the floor, and started to paint. This was three years ago and I&rsquo;ve never looked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ART AS A HEALING TOOL IN CLINICAL SETTINGS<br />\r\nSince the beginning of time, mankind&nbsp;has used the arts in a cultural setting for building strong community bonds. This has included painting, sculpting, drama, dance, music, poetry and singing. It was only in the 20th Century that the arts was used formally as a field called &lsquo;art therapy&rsquo; when doctors observed mental health patients expressing their feelings through painting. Since then, hospitals and health institutions around the world use art in conjunction with traditional medications to help improve the patient&rsquo;s state of mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When art is used alongside psychotherapy and psychiatry, the patient&nbsp;is helped by both the doctors and the art therapists to deal with emotions and fears that are bottled up. According to a research paper by Stuckey and nobel1, patients prefer art therapy to verbal communication because the art modalities help them express how they feel where words cannot. Visual art therapy has many facets to it: painting in various media, sketching, doodling, clay work, sculptures,&nbsp;art journaling, and all forms of handcrafting (such as crochet, knitting, embroidery, textiles making or jewelry making).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art as therapy has been used with prisoners, with sexually abused children, with terminally ill cancer patients, with those who suffer from chronic depression, and with those suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. With cardiovascular diseases</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and diabetes being the number one killer diseases in the UAe, it is possible to use creative activities to help decrease stress that can be the underlying causes of such chronic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BENEFITS OF ART IN EVERY DAY LIFE<br />\r\nNot only is painting used in therapy, it can be used in daily life. You do not have to be an artist to be able to creatively express yourself. It&rsquo;s not about learning a particular painting technique or taking a formal art study program. That means that excuses such as, &lsquo;I am not a writer, I am not a musician, I am not a dancer, I am not an artist,&rsquo; etc don&rsquo;t hold true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art offers a safe place for us to be just as we are without any judgement. It is a sanctuary in the midst of our chaotic life. It&rsquo;s about allowing us to awaken the deep desires we once had. Art opens endless possibilities in our imagination to find creative methods of expressing anything we want to. For many, it has a calming effect, which then decreases stress. For those of us who reach out for food or other unhealthy substances when we want to stuff down emotions, art gives&nbsp;us a chance to find better and healthier coping strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already practice prayer and meditation, great. In my case, I found that creative expression paved the way to daily prayer and meditation, as well as mindful eating, exercising and clearing the clutter. of course, life didn&rsquo;t change the minute I applied acrylics to canvas. Being creatively blocked for a very long time meant that I had to take baby steps. In time, painting helped defrost major writing blocks. More recently, painting has become my way&nbsp;of delving deeper into my third culture and cross-cultural identity. Art has truly become the perfect point of alchemy, where life becomes whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>YOUR &lsquo;GET ARTY&rsquo; KICK START</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get your creative juices flowing, buy a set of coloured crayons, pastels or acrylic paints and a paper pad then take 20 minutes to draw, paint, doodle&hellip; whatever comes up when you ask yourself the question, &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;Find 20 minutes of alone time. Turn off all mobile phones, TV and other distractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Close your eyes, take three long breaths. Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Breathe from your stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Meditate for a minimum of one minute up to five minutes (optional)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Ignore the chattering mind and thoughts that may attack in droves. When you find that this is happening, simply draw your attention back to breathing from the depths of your stomach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Now, gently bring to mind the topic of &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo; into your awareness. Go deep in your body and feel this question in your body. What is it saying to you? When you feel that question, what colour, smells or fragrances come to mind?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Pick the colour crayons of choice and start to draw whatever you feel like. Do not draw from your mind, but engage from your being. Your deeper self knows it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Use music if that helps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Refrain from any sort of judgement or critical voices that may come up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Take 15 minutes to paint away and find a way to close this exercise, perhaps with three deep breaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Enjoy your piece of art!</p>\r\n', 'brushes-and-canvas-450x337.jpg', '2019-07-28 06:21:09'),

It threatens the fundamental survival of at least hundreds of millions of people this century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HELL ON EARTH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already increased the temperature on the planet by nearly one degree; one more degree and we reach tipping points that are extraordinarily dangerous for our children but we&rsquo;re not on the path of two degrees, we&rsquo;re on the path of four degrees right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even the mainstream report of the International Energy Agency, which is the leading organisation for keeping this data, is a four degree centigrade world. You can&rsquo;t even imagine how dangerous that could&nbsp;be, where&rsquo;s the food going to come from? What is the quality of life going to be? We&rsquo;re still playing games. We have nice projects but nice projects do not solve the problem and we know scientifically what it would take, we&rsquo;re emitting about 35 billion tonnes of C02 this year. By 2050, in a much larger world economy, we have to be emitting less than 15 billion tonnes,&rdquo; Sachs said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you do the carbon arithmetic,&nbsp;we need to get from 35 billion tonnes per year to about 12 or 13 billion tonnes a year by mid-century. In per person terms, right now there are seven billion people on the planet so we&rsquo;re about&nbsp;five tonnes per person. There will be nine billion people by mid-century so we need to get to about 1.6 tonnes per person, in a global growing economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So the world economy is going&nbsp;to grow by three times but we have to cut back by more than half our carbon emissions, what does that mean? It means we need to keep the coal under the ground; it means changing to electric vehicles, it means radically different building codes, it means facing the fact that when we produce power, our energy has to be emitting about 100 grams of C02 rather than the 700 grams per kilowatt hour [of electricity generated]that is now emitted when we produce electricity.&nbsp;This is straight forward arithmetic but&nbsp;our political systems do not want to face straight forward arithmetic because it means making choices. It means telling the coal industry that unless you have carbon capture and sequestration, the coal must stay under the ground. It means saying to the oil industry that by 2030 our vehicle fleets must be electric powered, they cannot be internal combustion engine if we&rsquo;re serious about this problem. So far we&rsquo;re not serious about the problem, I pity our children and I&rsquo;m scared for them because we&rsquo;re not facing the honest carbon budgets of the planet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CASH AND COAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reality is that, if not one more drop of oil was pulled out of the ground, there is already enough oil and coal in reserve to meet the carbon budget. Use this up over the next 40 years, says Sachs, stop spending billions on exploration to find more and use that money to make the transition to renewable energy &ndash; which is critical for the survival of the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Instead of investing tens of billions of dollars in new oil and gas [exploration]when we have enough already, we would be investing that same money in the energy transition worldwide?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our politicians have a short term time horizon and the short term is continue to produce fossil fuel, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve grown up and that&rsquo;s what the engineers know by and large and that&rsquo;s how the world continues to grow. You look at how many new coal-fired power plants, more than 1000 are in construction or been approved for development right now. We are increasing the number of internal combustion engines by hundreds of millions in the next 20 years. What are we doing!? It&rsquo;s not so hard to do a spreadsheet to show how we are moving to a dangerous planet but we don&rsquo;t hear any of that in these discussions, we only hear the good news, we don&rsquo;t hear the bad news and that&rsquo;s the problem. We have to get real about a different direction, which is a different kind of energy system. One that is low carbon. The only low carbon sources are nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal or carbon capture and sequestration. There is no low carbon vehicle system except if we move to fuel cells and to battery. This is straight forward, so we have to make those choices and that&rsquo;s what global agreements should be doing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LOW CARBON DIET</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sachs said that one way to make&nbsp;the energy transition is to give the production rights to those who have&nbsp;the reserves right now. &ldquo;Run down the reserves, let the market price be very high, that would be good for the Middle East and good for the oil companies, I don&rsquo;t care about that, that&rsquo;s fine, but don&rsquo;t produce more reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s understand that we&rsquo;re on a dropping diet of fossil fuel and we&rsquo;re on a rising diet of low carbon energy. Current shareholders would do just fine but companies wouldn&rsquo;t waste their money with tens of billions of dollars of finding reserves of things that can&rsquo;t be used safely in the world. This is the big mistake and it comes because our financial markets are even more short-sighted than our politicians. It used to be that great banks financed great industry, they&rsquo;d invest in a 20 or 30 year forward industry but you look at our great banks right now, they&rsquo;re all short-term traders, they don&rsquo;t even know how to finance an industry any more, all they know is quarterly returns so all they want to do is trade existing securities, they don&rsquo;t know how to finance a new energy sector for the world. So that&rsquo;s my challenge for Wall Street or the city of London, stop being traders, start being investors again and that means creating a new energy industry not simply trading the shares of the existing energy industry, which is what they do because all of these companies are led by traders right now, not by industry builders. We need new industry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLIMATE CHANGE FAQS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there any harmless energy system?&nbsp;&ldquo;There is no energy system that is completely harmless so we have to make choices. The problem is that our fossil fuel-based energy system is the most dangerous of all because it is leading to global scale change that is unprecedented in the geologic history of the planet. It threatens the fundamental survival of at least hundreds of millions of people this century so I personally support nuclear energy for example, not because it&rsquo;s perfectly safe but because it&rsquo;s safer than a fossil fuel energy system. I support wind and solar power, not because it&rsquo;s perfect, they use land, they threaten the local environment but they don&rsquo;t threaten the global environment in the same way. So we have to make serious choices but we should understand it. In China, you cannot breathe the air, your eyes water and you can&rsquo;t even see. The last time I flew into Beijing, I had to circle for an hour because there was no visibility to land at the airport. That&rsquo;s the problem with coal, China has to move beyond coal because it&rsquo;s damaging, it&rsquo;s killing people, it&rsquo;s leading to disease and it&rsquo;s also the number one cause of greenhouse gas changes now. So there is no perfect system but it&rsquo;s the relative problem that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do we all need to do?&nbsp;&ldquo;By mid-century we need to get to about 1.6 tonnes of C02 per person (we&rsquo;re now at about five tonnes per person), in a global growing economy. In order to do that, you need plans. Governments need plans. You have to do everything; you have to go to electric vehicles, you have to go to clean, low carbon electricity systems, you have to go to very well insulated, air-locked buildings that use about one fifth of the energy, you have to go to smart grids. You have to do everything because it requires very radical transformation that means operating on many different fronts, not one magic bullet. And that will require 30 or 40 years of change with concerted effort globally, global co-operation on all these new technologies. We&rsquo;re not serious about this yet, we&rsquo;re just telling ourselves nice stories.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor&nbsp;Jeffrey D.

(128, 'Juice fasting in Thailand', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'travel', '', '', '<p><em>Detox expert&nbsp;Malcolm Slyper&nbsp;describes his 10-day Juice fast detox in Thailand &ndash; this one is not for beginners.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am&nbsp;often asked for ideas on how to do an inexpensive detox trip to a lush tropical island location away from the bustle of city life. So I decided to share a recent detox and juice fasting experience of my own. I&rsquo;ve explained all and included various hints, tips and ideas to use in your own detox efforts but bear in mind that I have extensive experience in detox and fasting and the regime I undertook is not for beginners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, the world&nbsp;offers a range of detox experiences from the mild to the more extreme with everything in-between, so why not escape to somewhere quiet and beautiful to undergo a detox that suits your body and health goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally like to be somewhere exquisite where I can relax into a juice fast detox. This means I can kick back and know with certainty that I am tapping into the most powerful innate healing ability that&rsquo;s wired into each and every one of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do this fast once or twice a year.&nbsp;Most recently, I chose a remote part of rural Thailand near Koh Samui Island in Southern Thailand on the Bay of Bangkok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I needed a quiet place where I would have access to fresh juices and daily Thai massage to assist with moving the stirred up toxins out of the body. Thai Massage is exceptional as an aid to fasting in that it helps move the stagnant lymphatic system; it also balances and harmonises the human energy field. When done&nbsp;by a talented practitioner the results&nbsp;are nothing short of spectacular.&nbsp;Past experience has shown me that 90-minute massages are most beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also needed a place where I had access to a form of energy healing to assist with the mental, emotional and spiritual balancing potential to which the fast would give me access. For me, this person is Jet Lei, one of the most talented energy healers that I have ever met. Jet grew up in a monastery in Tibet and in his early twenties he was schooled in certain healing arts. He later learnt chiropractic at a Beijing School of Martial Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily for me, Jet&rsquo;s partner Chai is an excellent Thai masseuse and together they live on the mainland side of the Bay of Bangkok so it was a no brainer that I chose this paradise location as my base for my 10-day juice fast detox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PINEAPPLES AND COCONUT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I rented a single bedroom beach house with kitchen and sitting room for 1,300 Thai Baht (AED 145) per night. It was located 50 metres from the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally I would set out to do a 10 day orange juice fast. However on this occasion, oranges were in short supply so I chose pineapple. All fruit are effective cleansers. Jet Lei still had the Vitamix juicer that I&rsquo;d brought a couple of years earlier so he dusted that off and presented it back to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it was time to bring in the supplies. A visit to the local market secured several kilograms of fresh sweet Thai pineapple. Pineapples cost 20 baht each (AED 2.5). Pineapple is slightly sweeter than orange and thus needs to be watered down more. As a result I&rsquo;d be using quarter pineapple juice to a glass of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pineapple has a herbal history of extracting lead and metals from the body. A study conducted showed that population groups consuming high amounts of pineapple had lower lead levels. The daily regime calls for a glass of diluted juice every hour, with as much water in between as one wishes to consume. I&rsquo;d also be drinking coconut water in between the juices to stay hydrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would occasionally substitute&nbsp;the glasses of water for an occasional coconut. The Thai coconuts contain clear white coconut water that is rich in both minerals and electrolytes. The ideal means to support any juice fast. A friend of Jet&rsquo;s agreed to pull down twenty fresh coconuts from a nearby coconut tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one law that should not be broken whilst fasting: The bowels must expel daily regardless if you have not eaten for several weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to ensure that my bowels would move on a daily basis, I carried a 10-day supply of the Lower Bowel Formulae, abbreviated as LBB. It&rsquo;s a remarkable formula originally designed to assist those fasting. It contains Cascara Sagrada Bark, Barberry Bark, Cayenne Pepper, Ginger Root, Lobelia Herb,&nbsp;Red Raspberry Leaves, Turkey Rhubarb Root, Fennel Seeds &amp; Goldenseal<br />\r\nRoot, it is available for purchase at&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LBB is a brilliant fasting&nbsp;aid and this formula means I can pick a remote location for fasting without access to any pricey colon hydrotherapy equipment or services. The LBB formula is remarkable at cleaning out old waste stored deep within the small and large intestine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having fasted extensively over the years, and also having done routine maintenance on myself throughout the preceding months, there was no real need for me to do a formal pre cleanse prior to starting the fast. It was already done, and I was good to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRE-FAST PREP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My approach to fasting is to use the preceding months to do a series of pre cleanses, whilst adjusting the diet to a healthier approach before embarking upon the fast. This method ensures a deeper fast yet an entirely uneventful and drama-free experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to my previous liver cleanse efforts, I knew for a fact that my liver was stone-free and in top condition<br />\r\nso it was ready swiftly to carry out any toxins released during the cleanse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had used the Advanced Parasite cleanse (PWA and PWE, also available at&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com)&nbsp;over the preceding months to take care of&nbsp;any residual parasite aspects. I had&nbsp;in addition done several months of kidney cleanse, six weeks on and six weeks off using a formula that dissolves any residual burden on the kidneys and leave my kidneys working more efficiently, so I knew my kidneys were in good shape to support the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that the key to an uneventful and easy fast is to have all the organs of elimination open and working as well as to be parasite-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I usually start my fast a day or two before leaving home, so that when I hit the road in Thailand I am already well into day two or three of the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the prior preparation, the first few days of the cleanse were a non-event. I experienced zero hunger or urges at any stage in the fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the third day, the body&rsquo;s innate wisdom realises that the intake of&nbsp;food has stopped and it switches into house cleaning mode. Over the next few days, the inner wisdom goes about cleaning out toxins, accumulated debris, and a whole bunch of &lsquo;mud&rsquo;. Each day this would be eliminated thanks to the bowel formulae.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HEALING TAKES HOLD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Days pass quickly. I spend my mornings swimming in the clear tropical waters, taking long walks on the beach, having a daily skin brush whilst soaking up the sun, as well as a daily Thai massage and the labour of blending and straining my own juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoons, I study Siezhen Energy healing with Jet Lei followed by an hour of Vipassana meditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the seventh day I&rsquo;m feeling&nbsp;the rejuvenating effects of the fast kicking in. The stress and accumulated impressions of my last few months are now forgotten. My body is healing and rejuvenating at record speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seventh day is my last day of the juice fast and for the final three days I would eat whole fruit only as a transition off the fast and return to a normal eating regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending the fast successfully is considerably harder than doing the fast. It&rsquo;s so easy to undo all the good benefits of the fast by a thoughtless meal in the spur of the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits have been great. I awaken fresh and naturally at day break each day. My mind is crystal clear; my meditations are clear and focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could easily have continued on past seven days, but the need to get back to real life and the demands thereof are calling me back to Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results available to us from as little as seven to 14 days of fasting can be miraculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that many religious, mystical and spiritual disciplines call for a forty-day fast. Sadly this given way to the modern quick-fix approach of treating symptoms instead of getting to the cause of the human diseased condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my hope that my experience may inspire you to plan your own personal maintenance time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MALCOLM SLYPER&nbsp;is the founder of Art of Detox, for more information on detoxing and fasting trips, go to&nbsp;www.artofdetox.com&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JUICE FAST ORIGINS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The orange juice method of fasting was originally made famous by Dr. William Hay (1869-1940). A prominent New York surgeon, many years of living the high life had left Dr. Hay excessively overweight and with conditions including kidney disease, high blood pressure and a dilated heart. Having run out of ideas, he turned to nature in a desperate attempt to resolve his situation. His success was modeled on the old orange juice doctors of the late 1800s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His method was simple, entirely natural and cost virtually nothing. Within fourteen days he had turned his health around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of his efforts was a complete remission of symptoms and within three months he had reduced his weight from 225lbs (100kg) to 175lbs (80kg).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So inspired by his results, he then laid down his surgical knife and drugs approach to medicine, and for the next 23 years, used juice fasting to help cure 63,000 patients from around the world with this almost zero cost method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He believed that there was&nbsp;not a disease that the fast couldn&rsquo;t empower the body to heal. He also went on to found the Hay method of food combining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juice fasting in Thailand</p>\r\n', 'pineapple-juice-1024x676.jpg', '2019-07-31 07:21:41'),
(129, 'Green Porsche power', 'eco&lifestyle', 'cars', 'cars', '', '', '<p style=\"color:green;\"><em>The Green Porsche Tried and Tested: Living with&nbsp;the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid. Car review by Adrian Maul.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After&nbsp;discovering that on paper the Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid is the most economical car that is readily available in the UAE I was then lucky enough to be given one to use for a few days. The S E-Hybrid has a 3.0l V6 petrol engine coupled with a 70 kW electric motor that can produce a combined 416 hp. The car reaches 100 kmh in just 5.5 seconds, has a top speed of 270 km/h and fuel consumption of just 3.1 l/100km on the combined cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so the numbers are done and it&rsquo;s proof that you don&rsquo;t have to compromise on speed and power if you pick a more environmentally-friendly car. But&nbsp;what is a luxury high-end brand like Porsche doing dabbling in eco-friendly? Surely they&rsquo;re only interested in good- looking, high performance sports cars? Nope, you might be surprised to know that back in the late 1800s, Professor Ferdinand Porsche started designing and developing electric cars and his Lohner- Porsche car was a sensation at the 1900 Paris World Exhibition; it was powered by steered wheel hub electric motors. Shortly after that, and to increase the range of his vehicle, he combined a petrol engine with the battery-powered hubs to create the first hybrid powered car. So in reality it is in Porsche&rsquo;s DNA to lead the way in automotive development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PUT TO THE TEST</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electric vehicles, and that tends to include hybrids, are most suited to shorter journeys where their batteries take most of the load. In fact if you had to do the daily commute between Abu Dhabi and Dubai then these cars really are not suited. Or is that still the case? I live in Dubai and work in Abu Dhabi, and the S E-Hybrid has one trick up its sleeve that can help here;&nbsp;it is a plug-in. This means that instead of relying solely on the engine and residual momentum to recharge the batteries, this car can be plugged into an electricity supply as well. This was worth an experiment then! So, sorry, but here are more numbers. I decided to do three tests:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T</strong>est 1: Short city drive</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First was a short drive out in Dubai, and here I drove for 25 minutes with four adults in the car and managed to get a fuel consumption of just 0.4 l/100km, this would compare to about 10gms of CO2 per km, staggering when average car emissions are around 150gms of CO2 per km. Remember though that in this scenario the electric motor does most of the work with the petrol engine cutting in only very occasionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Test 2: Dubai to Abu Dhabi Full Battery<br />\r\nThe second test was my daily commute from Dubai to Abu Dhabi, a journey of 118 km. I left home with a full battery having charged the car overnight, and was able to get a fuel consumption return of 7.4 l/100km. I drove the car in its economy mode (E-Power), which ran the battery down after around 30km. E-Power mode means the engine did not expend additional power to recharge it; leaving the battery low at the destination. The optimum way to use this mode is to plug the car into an external power source at the end of every journey. The fuel consumption achieved is remarkable for a car of this size and performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Test 3: Dubai to Abu Dhabi Flat Battery<br />\r\nI did the same Dubai to Abu Dhabi commute, but this time starting with the battery flat and relying on the car to re-charge the battery using it&rsquo;s E-Charge mode as I drove. This time I got a return of 10.8 l/100km, still very impressive for this type of car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Test 4:&nbsp;</strong>Sports mode &ndash; just for fun<br />\r\nYes, I also tried the car in its sport mode, not really a proper test as&nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t even bother to get the consumption figures, but boy is it fun! The suspension stiffens up, the response sharpens dramatically and the lamb is most certainly turned into a wolf, I was grinning from ear to ear through every roundabout and bend in the road that I could find. While observing the speed limits of course!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This car is a fantastic example of engineering expertise. It is very much two cars in one, a luxurious and refined sedan as well as a thoroughbred sports car for those with the need for a little adrenalin rush. It comfortably seats four adults. My only criticism of the car is that you cannot sit five people in it due to the rear centre console. The boot is of a reasonable size and more than adequate to collect the groceries or take you and your clubs to the golf course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WALLET DAMAGE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Panamera S E-Hybrid costs a little under AED 500,000 in base form, and nearly AED 600,000 with the options that you are bound to want. OK then, so why should you buy it? Let&rsquo;s face it, if you can afford this car you are not buying it for its cheap fuel running costs. What you are buying with this car is the future, the future of technology to come that other manufacturers are certain to follow; but more importantly the future for the environment, your children and grand children. If everybody switched to cars as environmentally-friendly as the Panamera S E-Hybrid then air quality in cities would improve dramatically, respiratory illnesses and early death from pollution- related diseases would decline and the contribution of transportation towards global warming would significantly reduce. When you take account that light vehicles contribute to about 20 per cent of global warming emissions in developed countries, this really is significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HYBRID TECHNOLOGY FOR DUMMIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrid technology mainly falls into two categories:<br />\r\n1. Standard hybrids that have electric motors powered by batteries as well as petrol engines. The cars tend to run off the batteries and electric motor when there is enough charge in the battery, and switch to the engines when additional power is required, or the battery charge is too low. The batteries on these cars are recharged by the engine, brake regeneration and regeneration from coasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;Plug-in hybrids have all the features of standard hybrids, plus the ability to recharge the batteries by plugging into an external power source such as a domestic electric socket. The advantage here is that the cost of recharging the batteries this way is significantly less, it does not take power from the engine whilst recharging this way, thus saving petrol. If you are only doing short distance city driving then your car can be recharged over night, and whilst parked at work, and the result is that you could use almost no petrol at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Panamera S E-Hybrid is a plug-in hybrid with a few additional clever gadgets to improve its efficiency. Its electric motor acts as an electricity generator when the batteries are being charged, either from the engine, during braking and even when the car is coasting, thus the maximum amount of residual energy is used efficiently and reducing overall fuel consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember however that if you drive a hybrid car hard then you will be primarily using the engine and not the battery so you will not get anything close to the specified economy or emissions figures. This is especially true for the Panamera S E-Hybrid as the driver can get carried away with the performance and capability of the car.</p>\r\n', 'Green-Porsche-2-1024x682.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:44:17'),
(130, 'The two month quit sugar challenge', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'holistic-eating', '', '', '<p><em>A married couple go low-sugar for two months to see what happens to their bodies and moods&hellip; words by Tamara Pitelen.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is&nbsp;sugar the sweet poison claimed by some? Is the amount of processed sugar in the modern diet responsible for everything from diabetes and obesity to cancer? How difficult is it to cut refined sugar out of your life and what happens if you do? That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re aiming to find out with a two-month low sugar diet. Our low sugar diet will begin in two days on the first of the month. My husband Adrian and I are preparing by doing some research on what we can and can&rsquo;t eat for the next two months. It&rsquo;s been surprising. His whole breakfast needs to change, Adrian always thought he ate a good healthy breakfast, namely a bowl of bran flakes with semi-skimmed milk, a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a strawberry yogurt. It&rsquo;s all got to go! On low- sugar, the idea is that we eat only foods that have between three to five grams of sugar per 100gms and anything we drink has zero grams of sugar per 100gms. The bran flakes have about 20gms of sugar per 100gms, the yogurt has 10gms of sugar per 100gms and the orange juice is basically all sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Adrian ate the whole orange,&nbsp;it would be ok but juicing it is basically like throwing away all the nutrition and fibre and just keeping the sugar, we&rsquo;re told. Who&rsquo;s telling us this? All manner of anti-sugar zealots including David Gillespie, an Australian man who lost 40kgs apparently effortlessly by going low sugar and then wrote a best-selling book about it called&nbsp;Sweet Poison: &nbsp;<em>How sugar makes you fat</em>. Is he right? Juicing zealots like Jason Vale would probably say no but since we&rsquo;re doing the low sugar experiment, we&rsquo;ll take David&rsquo;s advice for now. And he&rsquo;s not the only one. Sugar is the new fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Doctor Mark Hyman says: &ldquo;For years, we&rsquo;ve been brainwashed into thinking that fat causes heart attacks and raises cholesterol, and that sugar is harmless except as a source of empty calories. &ldquo;They are not empty calories. Sugar calories are deadly calories. Sugar causes heart attacks, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and dementia, and is the leading cause of liver failure in America.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m a bit horrified at the sugar content of some ordinary foods. Breakfast cereals&nbsp;are ridiculous, just about every cereal on the supermarket shelf is off limits, they&rsquo;re all packed with sugar. The only exceptions are rolled oats and Weet-bix. Soy milk, that&rsquo;s got to go because of the added cane sugar. Cow&rsquo;s milk doesn&rsquo;t agree with me so I&rsquo;m trying goat&rsquo;s milk. Might try almond milk too. So, what&rsquo;s our new low-sugar breakfast? Weet-bix, which has about four grams of sugar per 100gms; full fat milk; full fat natural yogurt, and a wheat-grass shot. On weekends, it&rsquo;s bacon and eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 7</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adrian says his appetite has increased and he&rsquo;s craving coffee. We&rsquo;re told this&nbsp;is normal because when your body wants a sugar hit it&rsquo;ll urge you to have something that it would normally get sugar from &ndash; Adrian doesn&rsquo;t drink much coffee but when he does he always puts in a teaspoon of sugar. Is his body creating a coffee craving to&nbsp;get that teaspoon of sugar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 14</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More disappointments for Adrian today, he&rsquo;s realised he can&rsquo;t have coffee with whitener like Coffee Mate and he can&rsquo;t have the office tea that&rsquo;s made with Rainbow milk nor the so-called diet hot chocolate drinks. They&rsquo;re all loaded with sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 15</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weigh in number one, Adrian has lost 2.8kgs and I&rsquo;ve lost 1.4kgs. Crikey. It&rsquo;s almost too easy. Will it continue? We&rsquo;ll see&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 22</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whoops. We fell off the wagon during a trip to the UK. White crackers, bread, cider, Baileys&hellip; and it&rsquo;s showing on the scales. Almost back to square one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 23</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everywhere I turn these days, I read something else about the evils of sugar. I smell a trend. Fat is apparently coming back into favor. I&rsquo;ve just read an article that claims fat may have nothing to do with heart disease! That it&rsquo;s been wrongly blamed all this time. Poor fat. It was in the 1960s that scientists were scratching their heads trying to explain the alarming rise in heart disease levels. A scientist called Ancel Keys grabbed the headlines by claiming fat was the number one killer. The food industry spied an opportunity and before long our supermarket shelves were swamped with low fat products &ndash; everything from yogurts to mayonnaise, biscuits and desserts. There was one man banging a different drum though, UK Professor John Yudkin who wrote a book called&nbsp;Pure, White and Deadly&nbsp;in 1972. He said the rise in heart disease correlated to the rise in the consumption of sugar. Unfortunately, Yudkin became the target of a powerful sugar industry, he was basically black- listed and discredited by sugar-funded opponents. A more recent anti-sugar militant is Professor Robert Lustig whose Youtube video&nbsp;Sugar: The&nbsp;Bitter Truth&nbsp;has had over four million hits. He&rsquo;s now rehabilitating Yudkin&rsquo;s reputation. It&rsquo;s at a time when obesity rates in the UK are now 10 times what they were in the 70s and the amount of sugar eaten has increased by 31 per cent since 1990 because of the &lsquo;invisible&rsquo; sugar added to products like tomato sauce, soft-drinks, yogurt, baked beans, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 28</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely feeling better somehow &ndash; can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on how I feel better. Wish I could say the weight was falling off though&hellip;&nbsp;<em>to be continued!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Results of the Quit Sugar challenge will be posted here soon.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>QUITTING SUGAR FAQS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I eat fruit?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, whole fruit. No, fruit juice. Some recommend that when you first kick sugar, you should go &lsquo;no fruit&rsquo; then introduce it again in a couple of months or at least stick to low sugar fruit like berries, kiwifruit and melon while avoiding the high sugar fruit like grapes, apples and bananas. It&rsquo;s up to you but if you do choose to keep fruit just make sure you eat the fruit, the whole fruit and nothing but the fruit (sorry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can I drink milk?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Milk is ok as long as you&rsquo;re not intolerant to it but it&rsquo;s got to be full fat milk according to the low-sugar- brigade because skimmed has too much sugar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this just a low carb diet?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. Carbohydrates are fine. In fact you must make sure you get plenty of good carbs like vegetables and whole grains (brown rice, lentils, legumes&hellip;) because that will reduce the cravings for sugary sweets.</p>\r\n', 'sugar-written-in-sugar-1024x608.jpg', '2019-07-31 07:18:22');

(131, 'Stress and weight gain', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'holistic-eating', '', '', '<p><em>Ongoing stress causes chemical changes that basically turn our bodies into efficient fat storage machines. Words by&nbsp;Allie McLaughlin.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&nbsp;all experience some form of stress each day and,&nbsp;in small amounts, it can actually be good for us. Stress allows us to react to situations when we need to think quickly and our bodies are wired to handle short bursts of stress followed by a return to balance. However, long-term and ongoing stress can&nbsp;have a negative impact on our bodies causing anxiety, changes in eating patterns, strong food cravings, digestive problems, and weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stress can be caused by both external and internal factors. External stressors might include a busy work environment and pressure from the boss to meet deadlines or sales targets, getting stuck in traffic when you&rsquo;re already late, screaming children, the phone ringing, etc. Internal stressors might be anxiety about a large family get-together or nagging thoughts of self-doubt or low self-worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens in your body when you&rsquo;re stressed?<br />\r\nYou watched a horror movie last&nbsp;night, it really scared you and triggered the release of adrenaline&nbsp;and cortisol through your body.&nbsp;These chemicals were still in your system this morning when you were out walking so the honking of a car horn had you jump out of your skin. Although the car horn was harmless, your mind perceived this noise as a threat and told your brain to prepare your body to react to the situation. Commonly referred to as the &lsquo;fight or flight response&rsquo;, which is designed to help you deal with danger, your body releases adrenaline and cortisol to help you respond to these perceived threats. The heart, muscles, lungs and brain become the priority for recieving fuel and all the other bodily functions are put on the back burner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our bodies are intelligent and automatically respond to such situations. Adrenaline makes the heart beat faster so it can supply more oxygen to the cells in the body. It also increases blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and the rate of breathing. The adrenal glands pump out stress hormones like cortisol, which increases the amount of sugar in your bloodstream by blunting the effect of insulin. Insulin helps to maintain a normal blood sugar level in the body. Although there is an increased amount of sugar in the blood (from both increased cortisol and suppressed insulin levels), the sugar is not getting delivered properly to our cells. It&rsquo;s like having a key that unlocks a door, but without someone to use the key, it&rsquo;s useless. Since the body is smart, it recognises the cells are crying out for energy (glucose) and sends hunger signals to the brain. This state of having high blood sugar levels for a prolonged period can lead to strong food cravings, overeating, and weight gain. If our satiety signals are not in tune, we end up eating more and we store as fat any glucose that is not immediately used by the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High levels of cortisol can also compromise one&rsquo;s immune system and therefore reduce the effectiveness of the digestive system, causing indigestion. This is a concern, because even if we are consuming healthy foods, we may not be digesting them properly and absorbing their nutrients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TURN OFF THE FAT SWITCH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper nutrition on a regular basis&nbsp;can help to combat your stress levels. However, the first thing you should&nbsp;do (before turning to food), is find out what is causing your stress. Long-term stress leaves cortisol levels high and then the vicious cycle of having strong food cravings and fat storage starts again. Is stress comes in short, sharp bursts and the body has the chance to return to a normal state, it&rsquo;s fine. The problems appear from long-term, ongoing stress. The hormonal storm caused by prolonged stress can increase your risk of fatigue, adrenal exhaustion, weight gain, blood sugar problems and high blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have managed your stress, you can use food as a support system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5 WAYS TO COMBAT STRESS THROUGH NUTRITION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat regularly</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to your hunger cues. Don&rsquo;t let your body get to the point where you feel you could eat two large pizzas. Eating on a regular basis keeps your blood sugar levels more stable, which in turn may prevent strong food cravings and overeating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat balanced meals</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of food offer different nutrients. Include at least three food groups at each meal and make sure one of them is protein, as it is satiating and can help you to feel more alert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat your fats</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn to love fat, it is your friend and ironically the body cannot release excess body fat without certain fats. Walnuts, flaxseed, and fish oils all contain omega 3 fatty acids. These fats may help to improve brain function and decrease feelings of depression or anxiety that sometimes come from prolonged stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drink more water</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is probably the most important thing you can do to combat stress. Drink water, every day, all day. Stress can cause the body to be dehydrated because when we are scared our metabolisms increase and we naturally sweat. What&rsquo;s worse, being dehydrated can cause stress itself, headaches, feelings of dizziness, and fatigue. So buy an attractive water bottle and carry it with you everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid sugar</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reaching for the quick sugar fix, such as chocolate or baked goods, is one of the worse things you can do when you are stressed. The high amounts of sugar in these sweet snacks combined to the high blood sugar levels from being stressed make the problem even worse and your food cravings even stronger. Not to mention, having prolonged blood sugar levels is also a risk factor for developing Type 2 Diabetes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t use food as&nbsp;a cure for your stress<br />\r\nIt doesn&rsquo;t work; I have tried it many&nbsp;times. The strong food cravings the body experiences are most likely due to the imbalance of hormones from the stress response. Instead, try having a cup of warm tea, going for a walk, or take five deep, long breaths in a calming or private place. If you really want to eat something and feel it will help, I recommend consuming foods that are crunchy. Almonds, carrots, seeds, or celery are almost the equivalent to the relief you get when punching a boxing bag! Give it a try, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work, don&rsquo;t stress about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ALLIE MCLAUGHLIN&nbsp;is Managing Partner of FitnessO2.com.

(132, 'Extreme detox Thailand', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'travel', '', '', '<p><em>For a short-cut back to wellness, Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa in Koh Samui offers a comprehensive detox programme. Tamara Pitelen tried it out.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s my job to find the poo poo; I am the poo poo hunter,&rdquo; said Aor, my Thai therapist, as she vigorously massaged my stomach and kept a close eye on a see-through tube to see if any of the desired &ldquo;poo poo&rdquo; was in fact coming out of me. Along with my other therapist, Wailuka, Aor gave little cries of glee when the &ldquo;poo poo&rdquo; did emerge. These women were serious about their work. For those not familiar with the joys of colon hydrotherapy, you are essentially hooked up to a machine via a tube up your bottom through which litres of distilled water are used to flush out your large intestine in order to remove anything that shouldn&rsquo;t be there, eg, impacted fecal matter, parasites, candida spores, harmful bacteria&hellip; It was the first of three colon hydrotherapy treatments I was having as part of my seven day Comprehensive Detox programme at Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa in Koh Samui, Thailand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I HEART DETOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband Adrian and I had turned ourselves over to the expert hands of Kamalaya&rsquo;s team of therapists and health practitioners in the hope they could help us reverse the effects of the so-called &lsquo;good living&rsquo; that&rsquo;s prevalent in Dubai. Essentially this means high stress jobs, social lives that revolve around all-you-can-eat-and-drink affairs, too much coffee, sugars, bread, meat and processed foods. It had left us bloated and pudgy with sluggish, overloaded systems, bad skin, dull eyes, and digestive issues such as constipation and acid reflux. Most of the time we could kid ourselves that we generally ate well and exercised just enough, but the truth was becoming very evident in the stomachs hanging over waist-bands and the appearance of extra chins. We were not shining examples of health. So, off to Kamalaya for seven days of extreme, take-no-prisoners wellness. On your first morning, you get a full body analysis which even tells you how hydrated your cells are followed by a wellness consultation with the therapist who will work out your plan for the week based on your goals. My plan involved a vegetable-based detox diet (forget any hope of clapping eyes on coffee, sugar, alcohol, or the &lsquo;whites&rsquo; like bread and pasta if you&rsquo;re detoxing at Kamalaya) and several therapies a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOTTOMS UP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which brings me back to the joys of colon hydrotherapy. Who on earth came up with such a bizarre concept? The Egyptians apparently. In the 5th Century BC, Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, wrote: &ldquo;The Egyptians clear themselves on three consecutive days, every month, seeking after health by emetics and enemas for they think that all disease comes to man from his food.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s it like? That varies from person to person. I&rsquo;ve heard some people find colonic irrigation no problem at all; they skip out afterwards like they&rsquo;ve been reborn. This was not us. For me, the first of the three was the most uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s the releasing of trapped wind that can bring the most discomfort but when your therapist tells you that a great deal of very old, dried poo poo is being dislodged, getting rid of that is worth the minor discomfort. But it&rsquo;s not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. My husband Adrian described himself as &ldquo;traumatised&rdquo; after his first colonic, vowing to never ever repeat the &ldquo;horrific was happy to weigh a kilo less afterwards. So why, you may ask, do people submit to this? Thanks to the modern diet of highly processed foods, the traditional and natural method of eliminating foods is often overwhelmed which is why so many of us suffer constipation, bloating, gas, flatulence and other delightful side effects of a dodgy digestive system. A course of colonics is like an internal spring clean. The primary benefit is, according to Kamalaya&rsquo;s detox booklet, &ldquo;the elimination of toxins and accumulated waste from the colon, thereby relieving stress on the liver.&rdquo; This can lead to benefits ranging from natural weight loss to improved lymphatic and liver function as well as that intangible overall sense of wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAUNA AND SUPPLEMENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What else does a Comprehensive Detox at Kamalaya entail? As well as the colon hydrotherapy, a busy schedule of daily therapies includes Chi Nei Tsang aka stomach massage, lymphatic drainage, Thai massage, and a daily sit in the Farinfrared (FIR) sauna. Not like a traditional sauna, a FIR sauna uses a narrow band of energy produced by the sun that is responsible for photosynthesis. Invisible to the human eye, these rays penetrate much deeper than a regular sauna in order to accelerate healing and release toxins. According to the Kamalaya information pack, &ldquo;studies have shown that most people have between 400 to 800 chemical residues stored in their fat deposits. It is the chemical load stored just below the skin that is the main area targeted by FIR rays. At 43.3 degrees Celsius, fat deposits become water soluble and can be disposed of via perspiration&hellip; a single sauna session of 30 minutes can burn up to 600 calories.&rdquo; Bring it on then! But that&rsquo;s just the therapies. In addition to the daily treatments you also follow a detox diet that&rsquo;s basically vegetables (prepared with amazing creativity &ndash; from pumpkin and coconut curry to juices, smoothies and herbal teas) supplemented with protein shakes, coconut water and a total of 31 supplements taken every day, throughout the day. This cocktail of supplements are specifically designed to support the detox pathways and the liver as it gets on with the job of putting out the rubbish that you&rsquo;ve been storing in your cells. They include vitamins C and E, magnesium, zinc, chromium, selenium, lipoic acid, lecithin, fish oil, probiotics, turmeric, milk thistle, dandelion, schizandra, globe artichoke, psyllium husk and flaxseed. Not to mention daily shots of wheatgrass and homeopathic detox medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOXIC WASTE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They did warn us that the first two or three days would be the worst. As your body is chucking off the toxins as fast as it can, you can suffer a number of symptoms such as headaches, flu-like symptoms, depression and weepiness, low energy and fatigue, restlessness and irritability, to name just a few. I suffered all of the above to a greater or lesser degree. One of the greater degrees was the headaches, that very first night I had a pounding, killer headache. A little man on the right side of my brain banging away at the inside of my skull with a sledgehammer. He carried on into the next day but he was clearly getting weary because the pounding did get weaker until on day three it stopped. Day two was also the climax of the lethargy attack. Kamalaya offers a host of optional activities throughout the day, walking, yoga, cardio classes, cooking workshops, spirituality talks&hellip; but I had no energy for anything but reading and sleeping. Happily, the Kamalaya library is a welcoming haven of calm. I settled in on the sofa and read for hours between therapies and meals. Or I would take my book poolside or beachside to alternate between reading and relaxing in the sunwarmed waters. It was all pure heaven. For anyone living the Dubai dream, life is a non-stop whirl of busy-ness. So the opportunity to be completely cared for in the lush, tropical beauty of Koh Samui is blissful. I was told that most of Kamalaya&rsquo;s business is repeat; people who&rsquo;ve been and then go back again and again. This is no surprise to us. We&rsquo;re already talking about going back next year. By the end of the week, I was two kilos lighter, my skin was noticeably clear (acne is one of my issues), my eyes were brighter and whiter and I felt 100 per cent better than I did on day one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IN A NUTSHELL: KAMALAYA COMPREHENSIVE DETOX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s included during a seven-day comprehensive detox programme at Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa (nine and 14 day packages also available): w Accommodation and full board (three Kamalaya meals per day, &agrave; la carte or set detox menu) w All beverages, excluding imported drinks and alcohol w 1 x Body Bio-impedance Analysis (BIA) w 1 x Initial Wellness Consultation w 1 x 90 minute Vital Essence Oil Massage w 1 x 90 minute Traditional Thai Massage w Detox Herbal Remedies and Supplements w 3 x 60 minute Chi Nei Tsang (Taoist abdominal massage) w 6 x 30 minute Far Infrared Sauna w 3 x 60 minute Colon Hydrotherapy w 3 x 90 minute Lymphatic Drainage Therapy w 1 x 60 minute Oriental Herbal Detoxifying Body Scrub and Wrap w Use of steam cavern, swimming, plunge pools and fitness centre w Complimentary attendance to scheduled daily holistic fitness activities w One wellness gift pack and round-trip airport transfers</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information, email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@kamalaya.com\">info@kamalaya.com</a>&nbsp;Tel: +66 (0) 77 429 800 Fax: +66 (0) 77 429 899</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addresss: 102/9 Moo 3, Laem Set Road, Na-Muang Koh Samui, Suratthani 84140 Thailand</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kamalaya.com/\">www.kamalaya.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>KAMALAYA also offers a yoga programme, a weight-loss programme, a relax and rejuvenate programme, a stress and burn-out programme, and a sleep enhancement programme.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kamalaya.com/\">www.kamalaya.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extreme detox Thailand</p>\r\n', 'kamalaya.wellness_01.jpg', '2019-07-31 07:22:04'),

Awakenings investigates cruelty-free cosmetics UAE&hellip; words by Tamara Pitelen and Katrina Valente.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re typical women who love make-up. We love how a new lipstick can make us feel like a million dollars and we love how mascara can make all the difference when we mean business with our eyelash fluttering. We don&rsquo;t, however, believe that some poor little animal has to be tortured and killed in the name of safety testing to create our beloved beauty products. Happily, parts of the world are coming round to the same idea. In March this year, the European Union finally banned animal tested cosmetics after a long battle waged by groups like Cruelty Free International, the British Union for Abolition of Animal Vivisection (BUAV) and The Body Shop. But the fight still goes on, more than 80 per cent of the world still allows animal testing for cosmetics products and ingredients. Worse, with the rapidly rising wealthy middle-class in China, global corporations are falling over themselves to sell to Chinese women &ndash; unfortunately China is the one country in the world where the government actually insists on animal testing so some companies that did have cruelty-free status, have now gone back on this in order to sell into China. This includes companies like Estee Lauder and Avon. There is a glimmer of hope though. On 6 November 2013, the Chinese Food and Drug Administration proposed to abolish the requirement for animal testing for cosmetics and domestic products such as shampoo, skincare or perfume from June 2014. Instead it proposes that industry cont. overleaf should now have the option to assess the safety of a substance based on the toxicological profile of ingredients, similar to the Cosmetic Product Safety Report under the EU Cosmetic Regulations. A definite and gratifying breakthrough but it&rsquo;s not enough. Happily, while we wait for all cosmetic companies to embrace cruelty-free, many cosmetic manufacturers are sticking by their belief that animals don&rsquo;t need to suffer so women can have lipstick. We&rsquo;ve compiled some of the brands and stockists that are available here in the UAE but if you know of any others that we haven&rsquo;t mentioned, let us know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email the information to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:tamara@awakeningsme\">tamara@awakeningsme</a>. com, we&rsquo;ll put this list on the Awakenings website (<a href=\"http://www.awakeningsme.com/\">www.awakeningsme.com</a>) and keep adding to it when we find new cruelty-free products. For this article, we&rsquo;re dealing with cosmetics only, in future articles we&rsquo;ll look at skincare, hair and body care, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. NEALS YARD REMEDIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This company gets a big gold-star for its commitment to cruelty-free cosmetics. NYR owner Peter Kindersley is committed to creating products that don&rsquo;t harm the planet or the beautiful, sentient beings we share it with. Traditionally more focused on skincare, the really good news for animal-loving beauty queens is that in 2013, NYR launched a cruelty-free, organic range of cosmetics in the UAE that includes eye and brow liner, eye-shadow, eye make-up remover, lipstick and lipgloss, foundation, bronzer and more. In addition, NYR recently added mascara to the range that will be available in the UAE first quarter of 2014 (this took longer to develop because NYR found it difficult to source a recyclable wand, bless them).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy it: NYR has outlets in Dubai at Wafi Mall, Sun, Level 1 (04 324 5141); Dubai Mall, Level 1 near Nayomi (04 325 3154); Dubai Marina Mall (050 189 3191); coming soon to Town Centre Springs.

TOO FACED COSMETICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cruelty-free brand stocked by Sephora, Too Faced is super glam, gorgeous and fun. The range has everything you need for day and evening looks. We love the Lip Injection for lip plumping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;contacted Too Faced to check their cruelty free credentials, here&rsquo;s what Juli Jones, Regulatory &amp; International Compliancy Manager for Too Faced told us: &ldquo;Our cruelty-free statement includes all individual ingredients as well as the finished goods. Our cosmetics brushes are also synthetic (no animal hair) and many of our products are vegan friendly (absolutely no animal derived ingredients at all).&rdquo; So, go and buy Too Faced products from Sephora with a clear conscience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buy it: Sephora has outlets at Dubai Marina Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Mirdif City Centre, Deira City Centre, Citywalk Al Wasl, Dubai Festival City, and Abu Dhabi Mall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sephora-me.com/\">www.sephora-me.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.

THE BODY SHOP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still feel cheated about L&rsquo;Oreal buying Body Shop but as a brand Body Shop is staying true to its cruelty-free principles and was a driving force of the campaign to ban animal testing for cosmetics in the European Union. In 1993, led by it&rsquo;s founder the late Dame Anita Roddick, Body Shop was the first beauty company to take action on animal testing by enlisting the support of its customers across Europe to support the ban. After a twenty year campaign, the EU banned animal testing on cosmetics in March this year. Next stop, the world. At the end of October, Body Shop presented the Cruelty Free International pledge to governments and regulators calling for a global ban on animal testing in cosmetics. Buy it: The Body Shop has outlets in Sharjah, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Ajman.

MARKS AND SPENCER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We already love Marks &amp; Spencer for so many reasons, their undies, their food hall&hellip; now there&rsquo;s another reason. M&amp;S are loud and proud on cruelty-free cosmetics. This is what they state on their website: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t test any of our M&amp;S beauty or household products on animals. We guarantee that none of the individual ingredients in our beauty or household products is tested on animals either, starting from a fixed cut-off date of January 2006. &ldquo;This covers more than 1,200 products and, more importantly, their individual ingredients, from lavender laundry liquid to tea tree face wipes.

Here are some of the common misconceptions&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 1: A product that says &lsquo;Cruelty-Free&rsquo; or has a bunny on it, hasn&rsquo;t been tested on animals. Not true sadly, the devil is often in the details. Designation as &lsquo;cruelty-free&rsquo; or &lsquo;not tested on animals&rsquo;, or even the image of a bunny on a label may only refer to the finished product, when in fact, most animal testing occurs at the ingredient level. Furthermore, while a company may claim, &lsquo;We do not test on animals,&rsquo; it could still contract other companies to do the testing. The only way to be 100 per cent certain a company is cruelty-free is to buy products from companies that have been certified by the Leaping Bunny Program, which requires that no new animal testing be used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or ingredient suppliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 2: If a product isn&rsquo;t tested on animals, it might not be safe for humans. Utter rubbish. There are many reliable alternatives to animal testing, including cell and tissue cultures and sophisticated computer and mathematical models. Companies can also formulate products using ingredients already determined to be safe. Cruelty-free companies can use a combination of methods to ensure safety, such as employing in vitro tests and/or conducting clinical studies on humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myth 3: It&rsquo;s hard to find products that really are cruelty free. No, you just need to do a little research.

(134, 'Meditate for More Profitable Business', 'eco&lifestyle', 'business', 'business', '', '', '<p><em>Evidence shows meditation can improve business decisions and save your company from expensive investment mistakes, so meditate for more profitable business writes Zoe Kinias and Andrew Hafenbrack of INSEAD Knowledge.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a practice rooted in Hinduism and adopted by those seeking spiritual guidance but meditation has become an increasingly popular practice amongst the C-suite elite. With CEOs such as Rupert Murdoch (News Corp); Bill Ford (Ford Motor Company); Rick Goings (Tupperware); and Marc Benioff (Salesforce.com) all touting its benefits, executive coaches are picking up on the trend introducing mindful techniques to programmes to calm the mind&rsquo;s &lsquo;chatter&rsquo;, assist focus and manage stress. But new empirical evidence suggests it&rsquo;s more than just a &lsquo;feel good&rsquo; exercise, and as little as 15 minutes of meditation can actually help people make better, more profitable decisions, by increasing resistance to the &lsquo;sunk cost bias&rsquo;. The sunk cost bias &ndash; also known as the sunk cost fallacy or the sunk cost effect &ndash; is recognised as one of the most destructive cognitive biases affecting organisations today. Put simply, it&rsquo;s the tendency to continue an endeavour once an investment has been made in an attempt to recoup or justify &lsquo;sunk&rsquo; irrecoverable costs. The phenomenon is not new; psychological scientists have been studying the &lsquo;escalation of commitment&rsquo; since the mid-1970s, noting its ability to distort rational thought and skew effective decision-making. Often it&rsquo;s a subconscious action, which can result in millions of dollars being invested into a project, not because it&rsquo;s a sound investment but because millions of dollars have already been spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AVOIDING THE TRAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s a mind trap you can avoid as suggested by the paper&nbsp;<em>Debiasing the Mind Through Meditation: Mindfulness and the Sunk Cost Bias</em>&nbsp;by Andrew Hafenbrack, INSEAD PhD student in Organisational Behaviour, Zoe Kinias, INSEAD Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Sigal Barsade, the Joseph Frank Bernstein Professor of Management at The Wharton School. Their research shows just 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation &ndash; such as concentrating on breathing or doing a body scan &ndash; helps raise resistance to this problematic decision process, and open the way to more rational thinking. &ldquo;Prior research shows the more we invest in something (financially, emotionally, or otherwise), the harder it is to give up that investment and the more inclined we are to escalate a commitment,&rdquo; Hafenbrack notes. &ldquo;In many cases negative emotions; fear, anxiety, regret, even guilt or worry over past decisions, subconsciously play a part in the decision-making process.&rdquo; Most noted examples include the U.S. military campaigns in Vietnam in the 1960s, and more recently in the Middle East, when mounting casualties made it increasingly difficult for the U.S. government to withdraw. On the business front companies regularly fall victim to the bias when faced with decisions on whether to pump money into a product after being scooped by a competitor, or to continue an investment as costs skyrocket beyond initial estimates. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a matter of a product just not selling as well as expected, as was the case with the Concorde supersonic jet when France and Britain continued their investment long after it was known the aircraft was going to be unprofitable. The sunk cost bias can also be exacerbated by anticipated regret, the result of thinking too much about what may, or may not, occur in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BUILDING RESISTANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the result, says Kinias, of both emotional and temporal processes. MRI brain scans show the mind&rsquo;s natural state constantly jumps around, flicking between ideas, switching from the past to the future to the present in seconds. Through a series of studies Hafenbrack, Kinias and Barsade hypothesised, and found that mindfulness meditation, by focusing on the present, quiets this mind-wandering process, diminishing the negative feelings that distort thinking, thereby boosting resistance to the sunk cost bias. They began the research with a correlational study demonstrating the link between trait mindfulness and an individual&rsquo;s ability to resist sunk costs. As people vary in how mindful they are by disposition, volunteers were first assessed for this trait. They were then asked to make decisions based on ten scenarios. Some were business-related; others were simple choices like whether to attend a music festival that had been paid for when illness and bad weather made enjoyment unlikely. As expected, the results indicated that higher trait mindfulness in volunteers translated into their having more resistance to include sunk costs in their decisionmaking process. In subsequent studies the team looked at the causal relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sunk cost bias in both laboratory and online settings. In each case, one group of volunteers was led through a breathing meditation (a form of mindfulness meditation) while another (the control group) underwent a mind-wandering induction, a simple procedure replicating the normal mental state. All volunteers were then given a sunk-cost dilemma and asked to make a decision. In each study &ndash; whether it was online or in the laboratory &ndash; volunteers who had undergone mindfulness practice were significantly more likely to resist the sunk cost bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LETTING GO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was surprising, says Kinias, was the magnitude of the affect that came after such a short period of meditation. &ldquo;In one of our experiments more than half the participants in the control condition committed the sunk cost bias whereas only 22 per cent committed it following the 15 minute mindfulness meditation &ndash; that&rsquo;s a pretty dramatic effect.&rdquo; &ldquo;There may be cases when processing of the past can be useful for making decisions,&rdquo; she concedes, &ldquo;but what our research suggests is that people make better choices in the present moment when letting go of sunk costs is required to make the best decision.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>ZOE KINIAS, INSEAD Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour, and Andrew Hafenbrack, INSEAD PhD student in Organisational Behaviour with Jane Williams, Editor, Knowledge Arabia.

Play therapist&nbsp;<strong>Tim Hydari</strong>&nbsp;explains healing troubled children through Play Therapy.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Picture this. You&rsquo;re struggling with a problem but your loved ones can&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s bothering you. Maybe you can&rsquo;t explain it clearly, as mental and emotional states can be hard to pinpoint. So you seek professional help. You look for a counselor, a psychotherapist, psychologist or psychiatrist and during your first session with this person, you nervously describe yourself, your life, and the difficulties you are facing. You hope that this information will be received without judgment and that it will be professionally analysed and reflected back. Now imagine the same scenario but with one modification. You are not an educated, experienced and articulate adult. You are instead a child who is still developing physically, emotionally, intellectually and spiritually. Suddenly this scenario, aimed at facilitating healing is counterproductive. This is because most young children don&rsquo;t have the cognitive skills necessary to verbalise their thoughts and feelings and therefore their inner world. So it begs the question, where do children turn when they&rsquo;re experiencing psychological difficulties? Anxiety, attention deficit, disruptive behaviour, developmental delay and persistent feelings of sadness are just some of the mental health problems that 20 per cent of children worldwide suffer from, according to The World Health Organisation. Some of the stressors that lead to mental health concerns include (but are not limited to) peer problems, bullying, struggling with schoolwork, death in the family, illness of a parent, family financial problems, parents&rsquo; separation or divorce and natural disasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TROUBLED CHILDREN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, there is hope for troubled children. An effective treatment option continues to develop worldwide and is now available in the UAE. Called Play Therapy, the treatment is an interpersonal, non-invasive and non-judgmental psychotherapeutic method that builds on the normal communicative and learning processes of children. The aim is to alleviate a child&rsquo;s mild, moderate and severe psychological difficulties whilst preventing the opportunity for new ones to form. The field has roots stemming back almost a century. Luminaries such as Anna Freud, Melanie Klein, Margaret Lowenfeld, Virginia Axline, Violet Oaklander, Carl Moustakas and Gary Landreth have all significantly contributed to its growth as a viable and worthwhile treatment modality in Europe and North America. More recently Play Therapy United Kingdom (PTUK), an organisation aimed at furthering good practice of therapeutic work with children as well as improving children&rsquo;s emotional literacy and alleviating their behaviour and mental health problems, has worked with the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), to have play therapy registered as an accredited and essential health and social care occupation. While there are other treatment methods available to children struggling with mental health issues, play therapy is now accepted and understood internationally as an effective and crucial mental health intervention choice for children. Recent studies, including a meta-analysis of 94 research studies, have proven its clinical effectiveness and efficacy across modalities, settings, age and gender. This is largely because play is the natural world of the child and it is through play that children learn about themselves, others and their environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHILD&rsquo;S PLAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand play therapy we need to be clear about the concept of play. Play is a child&rsquo;s natural form of exploration and communication. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has identified play as a right for all children to achieve optimum development. The American Academy of Pediatrics identified its significance in a child&rsquo;s overall wellbeing. Some examples are motor play (integrating muscles, nerves and brain functions), social play (reciprocity, cooperation and sharing), constructive play (controlling and mastering their environment), fantasy play (flexible thinking) and games with rules (social contracts). However children experiencing psychological difficulties tend to limit themselves or completely eliminate certain types of play, usually to the detriment of their development, or engage in solely egocentric or even antisocial forms of it. It is a play therapist&rsquo;s role to watch for patterns and themes in children&rsquo;s play so as to create responses that produce therapeutic movement. Play also provides children with a safe psychological distance from which to address their problems. Why is it that occupational therapists, speech therapists, physical therapists and other human service providers use therapeutic play with toys and games to facilitate treatment goals? This is because children, in a non-threatening environment, are more willing to engage in the therapeutic process and express their thoughts and feelings, as well as assimilate information and ideas, without fear of being judged. Essentially this engagement helps the therapist avoid fighting an uphill battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ART AS EXPRESSION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between play and play therapy is the presence of a therapist. During a play therapy session, the therapist is able to analytically deliberate on what is verbally, non-verbally and symbolically occurring in the child&rsquo;s play and creative activities whilst facilitating an environment for healing through the implementation of psychotherapeutic principles. Toys, for example, allow for creative and emotional expression, testing of limits, and role-playing reality and play therapists have a sound theoretical rationale for selecting and placing toys and material in the Play Therapy playroom. This symbolic play allows children to express the unmanageable in manageable ways. Play therapists watch for patterns and themes in children&rsquo;s play so as to create responses that produce therapeutic movement. So in a way the therapist is facilitating a supportive environment for communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mental health professionals, play therapists are specifically trained to use children&rsquo;s play as the basis of therapeutic interaction, strategically using it to help children express what&rsquo;s troubling them. Play Therapists attempt to facilitate a healing environment by drawing out the therapeutic powers of play through the adoption of particular therapy principles and the use of unstructured and structured games and activities. One of the therapeutic powers of play which are accessed include catharsis, a purging of undesired or stuck feelings. When a child has experienced a stressful or traumatic event, the trauma often remains stuck in the nonverbal parts of the brain (the amygdala, thalamus, hypocampus, or brain stem). However the ability to think through and process these events takes place in the frontal lobes. So how does a child move the trauma from a place where it is doing more harm, to a place where it can be resolved? Essentially the treatment needs to incorporate the sensations and actions that have become stuck. Playing out the event assists the brain in moving the memory from the non-verbal parts to the frontal lobes and therefore giving the child an opportunity to process, organise and integrate the traumatic sensations and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LANGUAGE OF TOY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other therapeutic powers of play, including but not limited to attachment formation (forming a trusting, accepting, respectful, reliable and consistent relationship with an adult role model), abreaction (playing out and resolving through play, past traumatic experiences), wish fulfilment (expressing desires possibly unacceptable or unattainable in a non-judgmental and safe environment), and mastery of thoughts, feelings and fears (usually through the use of metaphor). For the therapeutic powers to be safely and fully accessed, a play therapist will apply principles to facilitate healing. At the same time, toys allow for creative and emotional expression, testing of limits, and role-playing reality and Play Therapists have a sound theoretical rationale for selecting and placing toys and material in the Play Therapy playroom. Play Therapy International (PTI), an affiliate of PTUK, has a prescribed toolkit, which includes sand, art, clay, music, storytelling, puppets, creative visualisation and drama. Children benefitting from play therapy typically range from age three through to 13, however adolescents and adults can benefit as well, mainly from the creative arts aspect of play therapy. Whilst some interventions have lasted for six weeks, with one or two sessions a week, others have gone on for as long as six months to a year. The length very much depends on the child and the severity of the difficulty he or she is facing and is therefore decided by the therapist on a case-by-case basis. Importantly, outcomes of the process are measured through the collection of qualitative and quantitative data at the beginning, middle and end of the intervention. Remember that, by the age of around three, children are able to imbue symbolic meaning onto their play, which reveals that while the toys they use are like their words, the play itself acts as their language. Your child might be communicating his or her inner world to you right now and if there is a problem it is essential you begin to listen so that you can seek out appropriate help. The best way to listen is to play. What is your child telling you today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PLAY AS THERAPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Play therapy has helped children: &bull; Become more responsible for their behaviours; &bull; Develop safer, more adaptive and more successful coping strategies; &bull; Develop new and creative solutions to problems; &bull; Change the way they think about, feel toward and resolve concerns; &bull; Improve their social skills; &bull; Develop respect and acceptance of self and others; &bull; Learn to experience and express emotion; &bull; Cultivate empathy and respect for others; &bull; Develop self-efficacy and thus a better assuredness about their abilities; &bull; Enhance cognitive development through the removal of dysfunctional thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>An accredited Play Therapist and Trainee Supervisor, Tim Hydari trained with the Academy of Play and Child Psychotherapy (APAC), he has a postgraduate Diploma in Practice Based Play Therapy and a Masters degree in Developmental and Therapeutic Play.

(136, 'The Zen of Eating', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'holistic-eating', '', '', '<p><em>Forget fast food and instant gratification, eating should be a sacred act that nourishes the soul as well as the body. So, where have we gone wrong?&nbsp;<strong>Neha Jamani</strong>&nbsp;explains the zen of eating.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ancient yogis from many traditions considered eating to be a sacred act, where one living part of nature integrates into another living being. In stark contrast, eating seems to be anything but sacred in our fast-food age. For many, eating today has devolved into a purely physical act to provide sustenance for the body &mdash; but definitely not for the soul. The start of a new year is a traditional time to reevaluate your life and health so you might be contemplating improving your diet in 2014. Perhaps you&rsquo;re facing a health crisis or some sort of spiritual awakening that involves taking more care on how what you eat impacts you and the planet; or maybe you are in a new relationship and just want to feel and look better for your partner. Whatever your motivation, you&rsquo;ve decided to eat in a healthier or a more ethical way but sooner or later, you&rsquo;ll probably realise that &lsquo;improving&rsquo; your diet is not as straightforward as you imagined. Buy any book on diet or nutrition and you will find plenty of persuasive advice on what you &lsquo;should&rsquo; and &lsquo;should not&rsquo; eat. Pick another book and you&rsquo;ll find equally convincing advice contradicting the first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAT CHANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many mainstream books on nutrition advise us to limit our intake of fat, yet an increasingly prominent minority contends that traditional animal fats are good for us. One diet may push honey as a superfood; another says it&rsquo;s just as harmful as any other sugar. Some experts say supplements are absolutely essential for good health, while others contend they just give you &lsquo;expensive pee&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll discover that there are diets based on religion, ethics, nutritional philosophy, anthropology, cleansing, the seasons and even blood types. The health food explorer is faced with a bewildering range of contradictory advice all coming from seemingly authoritative sources. Choose rightly: you will be saved! Choose wrongly: you will land in health hell. How do you navigate correctly through these choices? You can choose a nutritional trend and follow it &mdash; with all that such a choice entails. Or, instead of trusting any outside authority, you can go down the path of self-directed dietary exploration and experimentation with your food choices. This way, you learn to trust your body and senses while choosing how to eat wisely. But how can you trust your body when it often seems to lead you astray with unwise food choices because of an apparent lack of willpower?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LANGUAGE OF CRAVINGS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a society, we from the misleading idea of not having enough willpower when it comes to eating. How else can we explain destructive dietary patterns when we fully know the consequences of poor eating choices? How else can we justify bingeing after a week of regimented eating? We incorrectly blame poor dietary choices on &lsquo;weak willpower&rsquo; &ndash; which then leads to an internal conflict over what we &lsquo;should&rsquo; and &lsquo;should not&rsquo; eat. When it comes to food, we think that what we want must be &lsquo;bad&rsquo; or indulgent. Therefore, we believe we need strong willpower to enforce &lsquo;better&rsquo; behaviour. This constant reliance on willpower reveals a profound distrust of our natural ability to make good food choices intuitively. Craving certain foods can be seen as our body&rsquo;s way of signaling nutritional imbalances. It is also well documented that in times of high stress we use food to fill in voids or to mask deeper issues. In these cases, our body is communicating to us in a language we might not understand &mdash; or even recognise as a language. We need to stop seeing the body as the enemy but rather listen to the messages encoded in the language of cravings, appetites and food preferences. Instead of second-guessing what our bodies need, why not tune into the language our body is speaking? Through these messages, our body communicates its physical and emotional needs. One of the ways we can understand the body&rsquo;s needs is to create a quiet internal space in which we can tune in to the cues given in our cravings and appetites. By using a Zen approach to eating, we can create that quiet space within. You might ask, &lsquo;What is Zen eating?&rsquo; In brief, Zen eating is a practice of eating thoughtfully, mindfully and in a state of gratitude. The tips below are designed to help you create this mindful space within, each time you sit down to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9 TIPS FOR ZEN EATING</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breathe.</strong>&nbsp;Before you tuck into your meal, take three deep breaths to clear your energy and come into the present moment with gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contemplate.</strong>&nbsp;Observe a moment of silence. A good exercise is to reflect on how your food got to your plate. Think about the people involved in the production, processing, transportation and preparation of your meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chew and Taste.</strong>&nbsp;Devote your attention to the physical act of biting, chewing and swallowing your food. Fully experience and enjoy each bite. Notice the aromas, textures, tastes and temperature of each dish. Through this practice, you may discover new flavors or evoke memories connected to the taste and smells of your food. Paying attention gives you the opportunity to fully know what you&rsquo;re eating and opens up a direct channel of communication with your body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat meals in a peaceful setting.</strong>&nbsp;Be it your table at home or a quiet spot in the office cafeteria, choose a peaceful space. You may feel you rarely have the &lsquo;luxury&rsquo; to devote your attention to fully enjoying your food or finding peaceful spaces to eat. In reality, this should not be a luxury, but a necessary part of your meal. As you start a practice of Zen eating, take small steps to integrate this practice into your routine. Have just one meal a day in a peaceful setting, if it is too difficult to do this practice for each and every meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Go device-free at mealtimes.</strong>&nbsp;Ditch the multi-tasking while you eat. Stay away from the phone, television and the computer at mealtime. Focus on what&rsquo;s on your plate and engage in conversations with your dining companions. Or just be with yourself and your food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be patient.</strong>&nbsp;You cannot expect to gain instant understanding of your body&rsquo;s messages. Be patient while you learn the language your body speaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Distinguish appetites from cravings.</strong>&nbsp;Pause and ask yourself: &ldquo;Am I really hungry or am I just trying to change my emotions?&rdquo; Is my body calling for sustenance? Or do I simply crave a specific taste?&rdquo; As you become more fluent in your body&rsquo;s language, you will become more able to distinguish between appetite and craving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat food close to its natural state.</strong>&nbsp;In our fast-paced society, we depend a lot on processed and ready to eat foods, which are loaded with additives. By choosing foods that are as close to their natural state as possible, we can keep our choices simple and more healthful. As food writer Michael Pollan advises, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat anything your grandmother wouldn&rsquo;t recognise as food.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be dogmatic.</strong>&nbsp;People often feel wonderful on a special diet for a short time, but that great feeling of wellbeing doesn&rsquo;t always last. Cleansing diets such as veganism, raw foods or juicing bring great short-term results but cannot sustain the body&rsquo;s long term and changing nutritional requirements. Be flexible in your food philosophies rather than feeling that you must become a hardcore adherent of any one &ldquo;diet.&rdquo; You may struggle with this at first but with practice Zen eating becomes natural and pleasurable. While there is a lot of conflicting information out there, listening to your body will guide you towards a way of eating that&rsquo;s right for you.

(137, 'Attracting wealth with Feng Shui', 'eco&lifestyle', 'eco & lifestyle', 'homelife', '', '', '<p><em>Can moving your sofa make you rich? Tamara Pitelen hires a Feng Shui master to turn her home into a money magnet.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most people, my knowledge of Feng Shui did not go very deep. I knew it originated in China and had something to do with channeling the flow of energy. If energy got stuck it was bad and the right energy had to be flowing properly if you wanted harmony, health money, love&hellip; that sort of thing. I had a vague idea that by moving your furniture or putting a few plants around the house, you could change the flow of energy in your home to attract more money into your life &ndash; and it was the attracting more wealth theory that I wanted to test. So, I called up one of Dubai&rsquo;s best Feng Shui consultants, Cristiano Falconi, and asked him to pop over and assess our villa in The Lakes, Dubai, for attracting more financial abundance. Heck, it was worth a try. When he came over the following weekend, the first thing Cris corrected me on was the belief that there are certain across-the-board rules in Feng Shui that everyone could apply, like putting plants in the corners or not hanging mirrors up in certain rooms. &ldquo;In Feng Shui, every house is like a person, it has a different soul so it&rsquo;s very difficult to give generic rules.&rdquo; So just moving my sofa would not, unfortunately, make me rich. Unless someone had hidden gold bars beneath it. Unlikely. Feng Shui teaches that a person&rsquo;s life is influenced by three forces; their astrological chart; their home and surroundings, and their destiny. It is only the first two forces that can be changed. Feng Shui is to a building what acupuncture is to the body. It ensures there are no blockages in the meridians of your premises. &ldquo;Your house can affect 33.3 per cent of your life so the right Feng Shui done in line with your horoscope can affect 66.6 per cent of your life. The other third is your karma and destiny, this we cannot affect,&rdquo; Cris says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOME AND HEART</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Cris, your home represents your life and each part of your home represents a part of your body as well as an aspect of your life such as health, career, money, relationships, children, etc. in some homes, he said, certain aspects are missing perhaps due to the layout of the house, for example an L shaped building, which impacts the lives of the people living there. &ldquo;If a house is missing the children part, this is not such a problem for a 55-year-old couple but if you&rsquo;re a couple in their 30s who want children, your home is not supporting this.&rdquo; Cris wants to make it clear though that there are no good or bad houses. &ldquo;There is no bad luck or good luck, there are just energies that support what you want in life and energies that don&rsquo;t, so the question is, &lsquo;is this house supporting what I want?&rsquo; &ldquo;In May I worked on a big villa in Arabian Ranches. The owner told me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sold my business, I&rsquo;m moving into the his villa for two or three years and I don&rsquo;t want to work, I want to relax.&rsquo; &ldquo;So I checked the energy of the house and I told him, &lsquo;sorry, you will not sit doing nothing in this house, the energy for new projects is just too strong&hellip; I give it six months before you are once again very busy with work.&rsquo; &ldquo;The villa was highly charged with new project energy. A new project could be a business, a child, a marriage, and so on. A month later he called me and told me that since he moved into this house, he had already started three new businesses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENERGY WORK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next weekend Cris comes round for our initial consultation. In all, Cris came to our house three times, the first to take an exhaustive list of measurements, the second to tell us what changes we needed to make in our home based on those measurements, and the third time to review the changes we&rsquo;d made. On that first day, he noted down our dates of birth and then starting walking around outside the property, taking measurements with a Chinese compass. &ldquo;I take my compass, which is called the Luopan,&rdquo; Cris explained. &ldquo;I take measurements all over your property, from your main door, back door and so on, so the combination of the energy that is entering from the main door and exiting from the back door that is pushing you towards your future, will give me the idea of the energy that you have inside the house. The outside always affects the inside, so during a consultation it is extremely important to check outside your house. &ldquo;First I check around your villa, do you have another villa attached? Do you have an empty space or a garden? Is it blockedor an open view? Then I pay attention to the form and shape, which kind of plants do you have and what shapes are your plants? From which direction is the energy coming? If you have a road outside, is the traffic coming from the right or the left? Then I have to check if there are any big lights pointing onto your main door, and how is the access and size of your main door and which energy is entering from your main door because the energy that is entering your house will combine with the inside energy as well as with your personal energy, which I get from your date of birth. From this I can see if this house is auspicious for you or which portion of the house is extremely important for you. It&rsquo;s an in-depth study. &ldquo;Once I have all this information, I know the strong points and the weak points of the house. Every house has some aspects that are positive, or let&rsquo;s say strong, and some aspects that are weak so we try to increase health, harmony, money and try to slow down all the bad energy that sometimes attacks the house.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FENG SHUI VERDICT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Cris&rsquo;s second visit, he told us what the numerous measurements and calculations he&rsquo;d taken had revealed about how our home was affecting our lives as well as what we needed to do to attract more wealth. For a start, he said, the layout of the villa was not ideal. The wall between the kitchen and lounge was blocking energy but since we were renting our villa, there&rsquo;s not much we could do about that. And it was nothing to worry about he, said, there is no such thing as the perfect Chi home and no matter what the issue, a good Feng Shui practitioner will find a solution. In our home, he said there were several things that were not supporting the flow of wealth, Cris said, including the flower bed at the front door, the aloe vera plants we had in the flower bed (too spikey) and the size of the door &ndash; it was too small. &ldquo;The door is the mouth of the house,&rdquo; Cris said, &ldquo;it must be big enough to feed the home with energy.&rdquo; The main points he made were that we had two rooms supporting money and new projects, these were the downstairs study and the bedroom above it on the second floor. Cris said we had to use these rooms as often as possible and to paint them in shades of green and blue &ndash; colours of the sea. He also told us that our villa did not have an aspect that supported children. Luckily, we had no problem with that. In addition, we needed to put a water fountain by the front door and a curtain at the bottom of the staircase &ndash; because money energy was flowing down the stairs and straight out the front door &ndash; and we needed a small Buddha temple erected in a certain position in the backyard. He also wanted us to severely trim back one of the big palm trees in our back yard because it was, he said, blocking my feminine energy. So, we got to work. We filled the entrance of the house with pretty flowers and plants and moved the aloe vera into the backyard. We installed a water fountain out front, got our palm tree cut back, repainted the study and second bedroom in greens and blues, put a curtain at the bottom of the stairs, put up a small Buddha temple in the back yard, changed the colours in the lounge to white and got rid of all the red accessories. It all took a few weeks and cost us a few thousand dirham. The result? It feels 100 per cent better. Our home feels lighter and more welcoming and a nicer place to be. We&rsquo;re really happy with the changes. Has it made us rich? Not so far but we&rsquo;ll need a few more months before this experiment can be called a success or failure. As Cris said though, we need to make some effort as well because the energy can support you and help things flow but it can&rsquo;t act for you. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you to catch the right energy, you cannot sit on the sofa waiting for the Feng Shui to bring you good luck.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OUR VILLA DIAGNOSIS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We had Feng Shui Master Cristiano Falconi come round to our villa in The Lakes, Dubai, to see what could be done about our increasing wealth and abundance. Cris carried out a consultation in accordance with Chue Style Feng Shui. This knowledge can be traced back to the Imperial Courts of China and to the Chan family of the Song Dynasty in 960AD.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OUTSIDE 1. The outside flowerbed is blocking the flow of Chi (= energy) into the house. It will be very helpful to remove it. If not possible, remove the aloe vera and put some coloured flowers. Cactus is strictly forbidden. Suggested flowers are: a. Tecoma Smithii b. Hibiscus c. Jatropha Integerrima</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. In this corner by the front door it will be extremely auspicious to have a water fountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The small garden in front of the main door must be rich with coloured flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. In the backyard, in the direction discussed, you must organise a small temple with a stone Buddha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Trim the big palm tree as discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INSIDE Ground Floor:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. In the office and in the entrance hall you need to have some green on the walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. In the living room it will be very auspicious to add some purple, burgundy or, if you prefer some green as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The window&rsquo;s wall in the kitchen must be navy blue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The stairs are facing the Main Door. You MUST put a curtain before the stairs to stop the money energy flowing out the front door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1st Floor:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Try to use the third bedroom as much as you can. Add green or black. If possible also paint the ceiling in a light tone of green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. In the upstairs bathroom it will be auspicious to add four to five stones, like river stones, around the toilet. Definitely not crystals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>CRISTIANO FALCONI FENG SHUI &amp; INTERIORS for residential and corporate Feng Shui interior design consultancy.

There are many different Feng Shui schools, all with different viewpoints. Feng Shui is divided into two main branches &ndash; modern and classical. The modern school of Feng Shui is popular in the Western world and started getting a foothold in early 1960s. However there is no strong scientific basis to this school and it is mainly based on general rules and assumptions. Modern Feng Shui methods are based on the layout of a space such as house or office and the arrangement of the furnishings and decorative objects to maximize the flow of energy within that space. Modern school is further subdivided into various branches; Black hat feng shui based on Tibetan Buddhism, Intuitive feng shui based on intuition and Ba Gua school based on eight directions. On the other hand, Classical Feng Shui (aka Chue style) has two main branches; Form school and Compass school. Form school Feng Shui focuses on landscape forms such as the shapes of hills and watercourses. It focuses on locating auspicious sites for buildings and burials. The aim of Form school Feng Shui is to benefit from the energy generated by these landforms. This school is effective for external structures only and does not help with the interior layout. The second branch, which is known as Compass school of Feng Shui, is the most powerful. The compass school uses tools including the Luopan, a Chinese magnetic compass, the Lo Shu square and the Ba-gua. This type of Feng Shui further divides into several schools. Eight Mansions is a type of school that focuses mainly on directions of a person based on the date of birth. While Flying Star Feng Shui is based on detailed formulas and takes into consideration the element of time. To introduce Feng Shui principles in your home or workplace, take care in choosing a practitioner who understands the science behind this ancient discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Founder of The Alignment Institute in Abu Dhabi, Shivani Adalja is a Feng Shui and Wellbeing practitioner for groups or private consultations.

It&rsquo;s also the final full year of Saturn&rsquo;s stay in Scorpio. What does it mean for your horoscope? Astrologer&nbsp;<strong>Jessica Adams</strong>&nbsp;reveals&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARIES It took ages to get off the ground, but the plans you made for your house, flat, family, household, home town or homeland in the middle of 2013 will take you further than you dreamed by the middle of 2014. As each welcome change appears, use it to to create a further one &ndash; you can&rsquo;t lose. The ongoing issues you are having with your money, property, business, possessions or charity will be over by 2015 but in the meantime, use a relative&rsquo;s position, the plus factor attached to your home or a real estate advantage. This will make or save you money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAURUS Right time, right place. Your big project or idea may take off online, or in the real world, but there is no doubting the massive potential, over the long-term. Your way with words, ideas or images is your passport to something very special by mid 2014. The technology is here to help you. Are you still wondering what strategy to pursue with your former, current or potential partner? Or even an enemy or rival? Take your time in October and November as the story will change. Yet from that point forward, do work on an approach that will see you through 2014 before the cycle ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEMINI The trick to your most powerful financial position in years, is to take each opportunity and make sure you stretch it to its maximum potential. This applies to your money, house, possessions, company or apartment, as between now and the middle of 2014 you could eliminate debt or accumulate wealth. If only your daily workload was so simple! You can make it easier by taking a second position where you get to escape from reality, or by building projects into your regular job which are like a mini-holiday. Difficult people and situations will end by 2015 in any case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CANCER Your relaunch will make you look better on the internet, and in the real world too, with substantial results by Christmas 2013 and a far bigger share of popularity or respect by the middle of next year. You may change your look or shape more than once, to your definite advantage. The situation with your children, godchildren or young relatives will disappear in around a year, but until then, try to come up with a strategy you can stick to. This also applies to any work or part-time involvement with younger people. You need a practical, proven plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LEO The secret you have been keeping since 2013 will bring success by June. From your birthday you will spend time and money on your face, body, style, image and online reputation. This is the start of an amazing relaunch which will take you through to 2014. You have one more year of challenges involving your family, house, home town, household, homeland or apartment. By 2015 you can put one difficult situation or person behind you and be grateful you had a good strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VIRGO You will make fantastic new friends by this time next year and also join, or start, a group project that will enrich your life. An existing friend will turn out to be your guardian angel more than once, and a team or tribe around you, which has been wallpaper for so long, is destined to reward you in amazing ways. The only issue for you is the internet, the media, publishing, language, written work or your voice. This is where you desperately need a management strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIBRA You are halfway through the toughest financial, property and business cycle in 29 years so congratulations on making it this far. Skip October and November for final plans but have your 2014 strategy ready in December. By Christmas 2014 you are almost at the end of the challenges. The wonderful possibilities for success now will take around nine months to fully reveal themselves. Your award, promotion, outstanding personal achievement or covetable new job will come to you because of your own proactive approach to a genuinely lucky break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCORPIO Dealing with all the image, personal appearance or reputation issues becomes easier in 2014 as you have already tackled two challenges. You will be completely free of this cycle in 2015 but until then use September or December this year to come up with a mindset and plan that works. You should be thrilled with the results of your efforts on the internet, in another country, with a foreign nationality or in a university by 2014. One success follows another and you will have more than your fair share of lucky breaks. A distant place on the map holds good karma for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAGITTARIUS Ifyou can sidestep control issues or power plays, you will be richer by 2014, thanks to a chain of opportunities involving your money, house, business, charity, possessions or apartment. You have already seen what is possible since August. Now you can look forward to the best opportunities in 12 years to save or make more. You will be pleased to know that your secret will no longer burden you, or a role behind the scenes will cease to bother you, within one year. To get there from here, avoid October and November for firm plans, but from December, create a strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAPRICORN If you are looking for a partner then one really good candidate will present himself/herself by the middle of 2014. A happy relationship or marriage will go to the next level by mid-2014, thanks to a pregnancy, property decision, ambitious trip or new business. If your partnership is unhappy then there is a way out, to your advantage! Did you know this is the toughest cycle in 29 years for friendship, group commitments and social media? The life lessons stop by 2014 but until then you need to give more thought to the mental attitude that you can lean on, to help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AQUARIUS Even though your career as a whole is very hard work, there are everyday lifestyle benefits for you until the middle of 2014. If you don&rsquo;t work this applies to your volunteer role or your student position. Try to use every opportunity you get to make the details of your day happy and easier, even if the general picture is tough. You should be thrilled to know that the biggest and best cycle for your love-life in 12 years begins halfway through next year. Any partnership problems will be fixed, one way or another. Single people have options. Happy matches will skyrocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PISCES You may have a professional or parttime involvement with younger people. Alternatively the good news this year may be associated with your child, godchild or young relative. Build your plans in stages and there will be some fantastic twists of fate which help you to your goals. You are halfway through the toughest cycle in 29 years for travel, foreign connections, the internet, education and publishing. It does get better, mainly because of the useful lessons you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE UAE&rsquo;S DESTINY IN 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE&rsquo;s character is her destiny. And her character is Sagittarian, as she was born at 10am on 2 December 1971 when she became independent from Britain. Sagittarius is the sign associated with travellers and migration. With Dubai leading the way, the UAE is famous for her cosmopolitan atmosphere and expat population. Tourism and aviation are among her biggest industries. Sagittarius also rules anything big &ndash; thus, Burj Khalifa and Dubai Mall. This sign also rules horses, hence the Dubai World Cup. What does this year hold for the Emirates? First of all, a tourist boom, resulting in a massive increase of visitors starting at the end of July, which continues into the first half of 2015. A successful bid for a major world event will occur by mid-2015. This year also sees an economic boom, with a miraculous revival for some industries in September 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>JESSICA ADAMS is a best-selling author and astrologer for Cosmopolitan, Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar, Star Times, Australian Women&rsquo;s Weekly.

Lowest polluting petrol cars UAE', 'eco&lifestyle', 'cars', 'cars', '', '', '<p><em>You can&rsquo;t afford one of few hybrids available in the UAE but you want to reduce the amount of toxic CO2 you&rsquo;re pumping into the air (you know, the deadly greenhouse gases that are contributing to climate change) &ndash; what do you do? Read our guide on which cars available in the UAE produce the lowest amounts of CO2&hellip;</em><br />\r\n<em>Words by Adrian Maul.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last issue of&nbsp;<em>Awakenings</em>&nbsp;magazine (Sept- Nov 2013), we looked at hybrid cars in the UAE and I concluded that the&nbsp;most eco-friendly cars available in the Emirates were high-end luxury brands such as the hybrid Porsche, Lexus, Fisker Karma, and soon the Maclaren P1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many people can&rsquo;t&nbsp;afford a high-end hybrid so now and&nbsp;in future issues, I reveal the most environmentally-conscious, lowest CO2 emitting vehicles available from petrol and hybrid cars in all classes, from superminis to SUVs. That&rsquo;s a lot of cars so for this issue, I look at the most efficient cars in the following classes:<br />\r\n* Superminis<br />\r\n* Small, medium and large saloons<br />\r\n* Small, medium and large prestige</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These cars may be hybrids or exclusively powered by petrol engines that have good fuel efficiency and low CO2 emissions. I have excluded diesels as the manufacturers claim that because the quality of diesel available in the UAE is poor and it&rsquo;s significantly more expensive than petrol, they do not tend to supply diesels for this market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have only taken into account cars and engines that are available in the UAE, and graded them for their economy and emissions, but if there&rsquo;s a car just outside the top three that&rsquo;s worth a mention for some reason, I&rsquo;ve highlighted it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where available, I have used&nbsp;the European standards for fuel consumption (Directive 93/116/EC) and CO2 emissions since these statistics are not formalised for the UAE. The fuel&nbsp;consumption figure I have used is the combined figure which is an average of the urban and extra urban parts of the test, weighted by the distances covered in each part. Both parts of the test are run on a rolling road as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Superminis</strong><br />\r\nThis class of car falls between the very small city cars such&nbsp;as the Fiat 500 or Smart car. There is a wide range available&nbsp;across the manufacturers, and for this survey I considered 21&nbsp;different cars. The Mitsubishi Mirage wins the Supermini class. It&nbsp;has a 1.2 litre 3 cylinder engine mated to a Continuously Variable&nbsp;Transmission (CVT) wide ratio gearbox to keep the engine speed&nbsp;optimal for performance and fuel economy. Not the quickest car on&nbsp;the block, well actually fairly slow. For those wanting a little more&nbsp;agility and style then the Audi A1 would make a good option, still with&nbsp;very impressive fuel economy and emission figures, but with a bit more&nbsp;oomph to get you along that little bit quicker. One to also consider would be the&nbsp;Alfa Romeo Mito, which is a little quicker again than the Audi A1, but still returns good economy and emissions at 5.6l/km and CO2 of 129g/km.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The urban test covers a distance of 4km with a series of accelerations,&nbsp;steady speeds, decelerations and idling. Maximum speed is 50kmh, average speed 19kmh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The extra urban test covers a distance of 7km, again with a series of accelerations, steady speeds, decelerations and idling. Maximum speed is 120kmh, average speed 63kmh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Small family car</strong><br />\r\nThe small family car class are between 4.1m and 4.75m long, they&nbsp;sit four adults in relative comfort. Again this class includes a large number of vehicles and for this survey I considered 36 cars of which the iconic VW Golf is the winner. VW have made great advances with petrol engine technology, their TSI engine range which are turbo-charged and sometimes super-charged as well, combined with direct fuel injection have proved to provide a very small&nbsp;engine capable of great economy, low emissions and remarkable power output. For those on a smaller budget then the Toyota and Kia are also a good option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MediumLarge Size Family Car</strong><br />\r\nI have combined the medium and large family cars as there are so few large family cars to stand-alone. This size of&nbsp;car comfortably seats four to five adults, they tend to have much more luggage space than their smaller counterparts. I considered 25 cars in this class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The winner for this class with impressively low economy and&nbsp;CO2 emission figures was the Mazda 6. The Peugeot is another&nbsp;good example of how smaller engine development has come along&nbsp;in recent years, with the ability of a smaller engine out-performing on&nbsp;speed and acceleration much larger engines. Peugeot uses variable valve&nbsp;technology combined with a high pressure turbo and stop start technology to&nbsp;produce smaller highly efficient engines that can effectively compete on performance with much larger engines, whilst reducing fuel consumption and emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Premium Compact</strong><br />\r\nThe premium compact class of cars is fairly exclusive; I only found&nbsp;12 cars to compare here across a number of manufacturers that&nbsp;were primarily European. This class of car is aimed at two adults&nbsp;sitting in the front. Rear seats could fit children but may be a little&nbsp;cramped for larger adults. The winner here is the first hybrid to be<br />\r\nencountered, and as a result the Lexus with its hybrid transmission&nbsp;produces extremely good figures that beat its competitors hands&nbsp;down. The Lexus CT is not a plug-in hybrid, so relies on using the&nbsp;engine and regenerative forces from coasting and braking to recharge&nbsp;the batteries. For those of you that feel the Alfa or BMW in second and third place are a little too small then there is a choice of the BMW 3 Series or Audi A4 which are a very close joint fourth with identical fuel consumption and emissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Executive Car</strong><br />\r\nThis class of car is probably the most popular class of the premium brands with cars that can transport up to five adults in comfort.&nbsp;These again are primarily from Europe with a few Japanese&nbsp;marques in there also. I looked at 13 different cars in this class. All of these cars are very close to one another for economy and emissions and there is very little to separate them, though the Mercedes is the winner. The Audi and BMW are very close joint&nbsp;third place, but the car also well worth a mention is the second placed Lexus as through its hybrid technology it is significantly more powerful, yet with very favourable economy and emissions figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Large, executive cars</strong><br />\r\nThis is the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of luxury motoring &ndash; very important for the UAE due to the number of affluent residents. For this class of car I looked at 17 different vehicles from manufacturers across the globe. All of these cars sit five adults very comfortably and are often used as limousines or chauffer-driven private vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the large executive class it is interesting that the top three&nbsp;are all German manufactured, the top two of course are hybrids. The&nbsp;winner though, by a very long way, is the Porsche Panamera S Hybrid.<br />\r\nIts plug-in hybrid technology beats every other car in the survey for fuel&nbsp;efficiency and emissions. This class of car tends to be plagued with vehicles&nbsp;with large engines although BMW are launching a 4.5l 7 Series hybrid and Lexus&nbsp;produce a 5.0l hybrid in this class, which are efficient cars for their performance, but unfortunately do not make the top three here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SUMMARY<br />\r\nThe overall winner is the Porsche Panamera S Hybrid. The Porsche benefits from plug-in hybrid technology so it&nbsp;can be recharged from a domestic or commercial style electric socket making recharging the batteries much cheaper and more efficient than relying on the engine and brake regeneration alone. When asked&nbsp;about Porsche&rsquo;s policy on environmentally friendly cars in the Middle East Christer Ekberg, the Managing Director of Porsche Middle East and Africa FZE, stated, &ldquo;Porsche engineers are continually looking for ways how to lower fuel consumption, further reduce emissions of pollutants&nbsp;and CO2 and incorporate more recoverable materials.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manufacturer with most cars&nbsp;in the top three is BMW, their efficient twin turbo engines produces high power&nbsp;whilst maintaining good economy. BMW is about to start supplying hybrid&nbsp;cars to the UAE so may well perform even better next time round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manufacturer with the most hybrids on offer in the UAE is Lexus&nbsp;with four models, two of which made the grade into our top three of class.&nbsp;With the exception of the CT, Lexus interestingly use hybrid technology to make larger engines able to compete with their smaller counterparts on economy and emissions, but as a result have significantly more powerful cars offering a solution to the environmentally-minded driver who likes a little bit of performance in their car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the 19 cars listed here, nine are manufactured in Germany, which could give the impression that premium&nbsp;German brands are leading the way on environmentally-friendly cars, however the reality is that none of&nbsp;the mainstream manufacturers that produce hybrid cars, such as Toyota,&nbsp;Nissan, Peugeot, Chevrolet etc. have made them available in the UAE yet; all claiming that the infrastructure necessary is not in place to support them. I feel&nbsp;that this is a fairly feeble excuse, if the high-end brands such as Porsche, Lexus, Mercedes and soon BMW can do it, why can&rsquo;t they? Had I written this article for the UK then it would have a completely different set of results, check out www.cleangreencars.co.uk to see what is available there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly though, Toyota has supplied 20 hybrid Camry to the RTA following a three-year trial, which were found to have saved around 33 per cent&nbsp;on fuel and emissions over their petrol counterparts. Nissan has also announced at the Dubai International Motor Show that it will be supplying hybrid Pathfinders in the UAE shortly. Manufacturers are starting to realise that there is a market for eco-friendly cars in the UAE, they just need that little extra push from buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ADVANCES IN PETROL ENGINE ECONOMY<br />\r\nPetrol engines have advanced significantly over the past few years as a result of stricter worldwide emission standards. Many manufacturers are now producing smaller more efficient engines with the same power of much larger engines. This is achieved through a number of techniques:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Compressing the air prior to combustion, thus increasing the amount of oxygen available to burn. This can be done with turbochargers, superchargers, or in some cases a combination of both.</li>\r\n	<li>Direct fuel injection where the petrol is pressurised and the amount of fuel injected into the cylinder accurately controlled depending on the engine load.</li>\r\n	<li>Improved transmission by using gearboxes, which maintain the engine at its optimum efficiency for more of the time.</li>\r\n	<li>Using tyres with low rolling resistance. Tyre manufactures like Bridgestone have also made great improvements to tyre technology recognising that reducing the resistance between the tyre and the road surface contributes significantly to a car&rsquo;s overall performance.</li>\r\n	<li>Reducing the resistance between moving parts by using highly machined and polished moving parts, combined with efficient lubricants in the engine and transmission of cars.</li>\r\n	<li>Improved aerodynamics of cars reduces their resistance to moving through the air and consequently the load on the engine, ultimately improving fuel efficiency and emissons.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Lowest polluting petrol cars UAE</p>\r\n', 'girl-looking-at-cloud-car-448x450.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:44:26'),

Climate change is progressing rapidly, people who watched the Australian Open this week saw players fainting on the court because the temperature was 45 degrees centigrade everyday in Melbourne, an unprecedented heat wave. A couple of days ago the Governor of California declared a drought emergency, there are massive floods in Sulawesi that are claiming large numbers of lives right now, ladies and gentlemen, do not believe we are solving this problem. We are not solving this problem yet. And while there is lots of investment in renewable energy, there is lots more investment in coal oil and gas that is continuing to wreck the planet so it&rsquo;s one thing to say there&rsquo;s more investment in low carbon energy, it&rsquo;s another thing to say that we&rsquo;re really changing the realities, so far, no.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: What needs to be done?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have governments making serious plans to take into account arithmetically how much the energy systems need to change. This is an arithmetic problem, it&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;carbon budget&rsquo;, the atmosphere can only absorb so much carbon without having terrible effects in the world and we are not respecting the global carbon budget. And where we have countries that are not making serious plans to respect the carbon budget but are only talking about the nice things they&rsquo;re doing, not the harmful things they&rsquo;re doing, then we trick ourselves, we think we&rsquo;re making progress but in fact we&rsquo;re simply fooling ourselves, because nature does not care how many solar panels we have, nature only cares about how much carbon dioxide is being emitted by our fossil fuel use. That continues to rise rapidly and that is what we really need to face because we need a change of system, not simply more of the renewable. That&rsquo;s great but if it doesn&rsquo;t actually reduce the other; the part that&rsquo;s damaging us. We&rsquo;re not solving our problem.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: So when you hear about goals, targets, I&rsquo;m talking about the targets that exist at the moment, what do you think, are we doomed? Is there no point?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re doomed, I&rsquo;m here because I think we should open our eyes to reality.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: My point is that the targets are not enough?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;Look we know, scientists have shown us what it would take to have a two degree centigrade world. Now, let me explain what that means, we&rsquo;ve already increased the temperature on the planet by nearly one degree; one more degree and we reach tipping points that are extraordinarily dangerous for our children but we&rsquo;re not on the path of two degrees, we&rsquo;re on the path of four degrees right now. Even the mainstream report of the International Energy Agency, which is the leading organisation for keeping this data, their mainstream forecast is a four degree centigrade world. You can&rsquo;t even imagine how dangerous that could be, where&rsquo;s the food going to come from? What is the quality of life going to be? And that&rsquo;s the reference path of the International Energy Agency, so we&rsquo;re still playing games. Because we have nice projects but nice projects do not solve the problem and we know scientifically what it would take, we&rsquo;re emitting about 35 billion tonnes of C02 this year. By 2050, in a much larger world economy, we have to be emitting less than 15 billion tonnes. So the world economy is going to grow by three times but we have to cut back by more than half our carbon emissions, what does that mean? It means keeping the coal under the ground, it means changing to electric vehicles, it means radically different building codes, it means facing the fact that our energy, when we produce power, has to be emitting about 100 grams of C02 rather than 700 grams per kilowatt hour [of electricity generated]that is now emitted when we produce electricity, in a way this is straight forward arithmetic but our political systems do not want to face straight forward arithmetic because it means making choices. It means telling the coal industry that unless you have carbon capture and sequestration, the coal must stay under the ground. It means saying to the oil industry that by 2030 our vehicle fleets must be electric powered, they cannot be internal combustion engine if we&rsquo;re serious about this problem. So far we&rsquo;re not serious about the problem, I pity our children and I&rsquo;m scared for them because we&rsquo;re not facing the honest carbon budgets of the planet.&rdquo; Moderator: So when you look at the economic climate of the world, how does behaviour change when times are good versus when times are bad? JS: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t change very much, our politicians have a short term time horizon and the short term is continue to produce fossil fuel, that&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ve grown up and that&rsquo;s what the engineers know by and large and that&rsquo;s how the world continues to grow. You look at how many new coal-fired power plants, more than 1000 are in construction or been approved for development right now. We are increasing the number of internal combustion engines by hundreds of millions in the next 20 years. What are we doing!? It&rsquo;s not so hard to do a spreadsheet to show how we are moving to a dangerous planet but we don&rsquo;t hear any of that in these discussions, we only hear the good news, we don&rsquo;t hear the bad news and that&rsquo;s the problem. We have to get real about a different direction, which is a different kind of energy system. One that is low carbon. The only low carbon sources are nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal or carbon capture and sequestration. There is no low carbon vehicle system except if we move to fuel cells and to battery. This is straight forward, so we have to make those choices and that&rsquo;s what global agreements should be doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some individuals are attacking me on Twitter right now, asking did I fly over here in a bio-fuel airplane, of course I didn&rsquo;t! I have no choice; the airlines do what they do. They say, did I drive in an electrical vehicle when I rode over to the conference centre? Of course not, I rode in a regular internal combustion engine, that&rsquo;s not an individual choice. And when I power my computer, they ask, is it being charged by low carbon energy or not? We can&rsquo;t do this as individuals; these are systems we&rsquo;re operating with higher technology systems. Our energy system need to change and as individuals we need to take responsibly for telling our governments not to wreck the planet. But they are wrecking the planet because unfortunately politics operates with inertia. But this is an important meeting, here you have leading renewable energy but we need to respect the carbon budget and that means it&rsquo;s not good enough to do renewables, it only counts if we also stop doing the damage, and since the world population is growing; since the world economy is growing, it&rsquo;s very easy to do lots of nice things but also extremely damaging things at the same time, I want to hear from the oil companies, what is their arithmetic on carbon?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: Do we have any questions from the audience? Any oil companies that want to answer this question?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious, it&rsquo;s not a joke. Let&rsquo;s have a serious discussion about the carbon budget for the planet because we increased 2.5 parts per million last year of C02. We reached 400 parts per million, the highest level in three million years on this planet, I study the trajectories every day with my colleagues and we are on a four degree centigrade increase trajectory right now, as our reference point so it&rsquo;s not a joke, it&rsquo;s the real thing, it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re all here, we&rsquo;ve all spent a lot of money and burned a lot of CO2 to get here but to solve a problem, so I&rsquo;d love to hear from an oil company executive, how are we really going to do this?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: Any questions from the audience?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Young man from Peking University: &lsquo;We know the bad side of old energy system but what is the bad side of new energy systems? Is there anything we should know before we change from the old to the new system? How to protect ourselves?&rsquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;Excellent question, you&rsquo;re from Peking University? There is no energy system that is completely harmless, no energy system so we have to make choices. The problem is that our fossil fuel-based energy system is the most dangerous of all because it is leading to global scale change that is unprecedented in the geologic history of the planet. It threatens the fundamental survival of at least hundreds of millions of people this century so I personally support nuclear energy for example, not because it&rsquo;s perfectly safe but because it&rsquo;s safer than a fossil fuel energy system. I support wind and solar power, not because it&rsquo;s perfect, they use land, they threaten the local environment but they don&rsquo;t threaten the global environment in the same way. So we have to make serious choices but we should understand it, since you&rsquo;re from Peking university, every time you step outside, you cannot breathe the air and your eyes water and you can&rsquo;t even see because the last time I flew into Beijing, I had to circle for an hour because there was no visibility to land at the airport. That&rsquo;s the problem with coal, China has to move beyond coal because it&rsquo;s damaging, it&rsquo;s killing people, it&rsquo;s leading to disease and it&rsquo;s also the number one cause of greenhouse gas changes now. So there is no perfect system but it&rsquo;s the relative problem that needs to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: Next question?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hi, I&rsquo;m Erik Brynjolfsson from MIT. What are some of the policies we should be advocating and what&rsquo;s the mix between advocating for specific mandates on renewables; for carbon taxes or carbon caps, for subsidies, what are the ones that will be most effective in achieving the goals you&rsquo;ve outlined?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;If you do the arithmetic ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for the question Erik, Erik has written a wonderful new book called&nbsp;<em>The Second Machine Age</em>, I recommend it for everybody, if you do the carbon arithmetic, we need to get from 35 billion tonnes per year to about 12 or 13 billion tonnes a year by mid century. In per person terms, right now there&rsquo;s seven billion people on the planet so we&rsquo;re about five tonnes per person, and there will be nine billion people by mid century so we need to get to about 1.6 tonnes per person, in a global growing economy. In order to do that, you need plans. Plans! Governments need plans, this takes 40 years to make the energy infrastructure. The US has never made an energy plan. Never. To this day, we have brilliant secretaries of energy, like Professor Ernest Moniz of MIT, one of the world&rsquo;s smartest energy experts, we had a noble laureate just before him, Steven Chu but the political advisors don&rsquo;t let them make plans, so we operate without any clear guidance. If you asked how could we get to 1.8 tonnes per person, you have to do everything, you have to go to electric vehicles, you have to go to clean, low carbon electricity systems, you have to go to very well insulated, air-locked buildings that use about one fifth of the energy, you have to go to smart grids of the kind that Erik talks about in his book. You have to do everything because it requires very radical transformation that means operating on many different fronts, not one magic bullet. And that will require 30 or 40 years of change with concerted effort globally, global co-operation on all these new technologies. We&rsquo;re not serious about this yet ladies and gentlemen, we&rsquo;re just telling ourselves nice stories. We&rsquo;re not solving the problem yet because solving the problem requires long a term vision and a policy to support that change. All the technologies we need are either available or already in view even if they&rsquo;re pre-commercial but we need to work on them, there are learning curves, there are dynamics that will lower the cost tremendously just as the US secretary of energy said a few minutes ago, the costs have come down already by about 70 per cent for some of these key energy sources but as long as it&rsquo;s absolutely free to put carbon dioxide up in the air, as long as that&rsquo;s free, we&rsquo;re still going to continue to wreck the planet because we&rsquo;re allowing the total externality of just damaging the planet without facing the real social consequences. No-one here wants that for the next generation, believe me, we&rsquo;ll get by, at least at my age I&rsquo;ll get by but my children will suffer terribly and I really think that&rsquo;s unwise and unwise for your children too.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Q: &ldquo;In Germany we now have a plan put out by a UV installation company for wind and solar, who thinks that Germany could be at 100 per cent renewable power by 2020. We have a new minster now of energy and economics who comes from the coal-rich rural area and of course who is scared of losing jobs, could you talk to the point of the jobs evidence of moving from the old economy to the new circular, renewable economy, what is the impact on economics? And is worthwhile for Germany to take the lead or for Abu Dhabi take the lead on renewable energy, irrespective of the loss of jobs and the potential of new jobs.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there will be jobs lost per se, I do think that some of the new energies will be more expensive than the market prices of old energy if you don&rsquo;t take into account all the social costs associated with the old energy. So there&rsquo;s an accounting trick, when we burn coal right now, as Germany does, nobody that buys that coal-fired electricity pays the true social cost of ruining the climate or causing health problems so it&rsquo;s an accounting problem. The coal gets off cheap whereas what&rsquo;s really cheap for the planet, renewable energy, looks expensive that&rsquo;s because our market system is flawed. The market system is not God, the market system is a flawed creation that doesn&rsquo;t properly measure the true social costs and benefits of alternative technologies yet we treat it as something reverential, that it&rsquo;s only the quarterly earnings that count because that&rsquo;s the most important thing that drives our businesses these days. So we have to correct that impression, that understanding, and correct the market pricing. If you look at Germany, Germany said they wanted energy transition but they&rsquo;re burning more coal then ever right now so we&rsquo;re going backwards. Now I wouldn&rsquo;t say to the Minister that you have to do it by 2020 but I would say that you have to do it and don&rsquo;t back down from the energy mandate, the energy transition, it&rsquo;s a wonderful initiative. But for Germany to do it effectively it should be done in a energy grid that doesn&rsquo;t rely only on Germany&rsquo;s wind and solar but on the wind and solar power of North Africa, of the North sea, of the Middle East&hellip; all in an integrated system. You put concentrated solar power in the desert here and then with high-voltage direct current, bring it to Germany. This is very do-able technologically, that&rsquo;s why the Desertec idea of an integrated system of a Middle East, North Africa and Europe is truly the way of the future but there&rsquo;s a lot of energy nationalism right now so Germany says &lsquo;we only want our own wind&rsquo; or &lsquo;we only want our own sunshine&rsquo; that will raise the cost considerably. Or, &lsquo;forget it, we&rsquo;ll go to coal because we want jobs&rsquo; that&rsquo;s even worse. If we think about this systematically, clearly, with expert engineering, there are great solutions for the planet. Better systems, better transport, better buildings, better quality of life, cleaner air, survival of the planet. But it&rsquo;s not the course that we&rsquo;re on right now, because the market is filled with tricks and the tricks for the political market is decide things with a one year time horizon and the economic market is decide things with a quarterly time horizon based on flawed incentives that don&rsquo;t measure proper social costs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Q. [Identified himself as an asset manager] My question is about financial markets&hellip; you&rsquo;re talking about the carbon budget and if you compare how much proven reserves are with those oil companies, with how much carbon budget there is, there is already two to three times more proven reserves that can ever be emitted. Can we find a trick to get oil companies to buy in, that it&rsquo;s a good idea not to burn all this oil, do you have some thoughts?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JS: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an interesting question how these reserves are going to be distributed. Basically what we need to do is to say, we&rsquo;re going to use the reserves that we have of oil and gas by and large, keep the coal under the ground and not continue to develop unconventional new sources. So that all the oil companies here that are finding new sources, what are we going to do when we burn those? We don&rsquo;t need that, we need by then to have shifted to different kinds of energy sources. We should not be exploring for new oil and gas right now, we have enough in reserve to meet the carbon budget so everything of the billions or tens of billions of new exploration makes no economic sense for the planet. It makes sense for the private investors; it makes sense for the politicians but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for the planet. If we looked at this honestly, instead of investing ten of billions of dollars in new oil and gas when we have enough already, we would be investing that same money in the energy transition worldwide and then it would be clear for investors also because the current situation is that investors are going to find at some point they&rsquo;re going to suffer a major capital loss when the world finally decides that it&rsquo;s not going to be organised to destroy itself, but it&rsquo;s going to be organised for its survival, then everybody is going to be shocked, &lsquo;why did we produce so many reserves?&rsquo; So one way to do this is to give the production rights to those who have the reserves right now, run down the reserves, let the market price be very high, that would be good for the Middle East and good for the oil companies, I don&rsquo;t care about that, that&rsquo;s fine, but don&rsquo;t produce more reserves than we can use so let the existing reserve holders produce the oil and gas for the next 40 years but then let&rsquo;s understand that we&rsquo;re on a dropping diet of fossil fuel and we&rsquo;re on a rising diet of low carbon energy and the current shareholders would do just fine but the companies wouldn&rsquo;t waste their money with tens of billions of dollars of finding reserves of things that can&rsquo;t be used safely in the world. This is the big mistake and it comes because our financial markets are even more short-sighted than our politicians. It used to be that great banks financed great industry, they&rsquo;d invest in a 20 or 30 year forward industry but you look at our great banks right now, they&rsquo;re all short-term traders, they don&rsquo;t even know how to finance an industry any more, all they know is quarterly returns so all they want to do is trade existing securities, they don&rsquo;t know how to finance a new energy sector for the world, so that&rsquo;s my challenge for Wall Street or the city of London, stop being traders, start being investors again and that means creating a new energy industry not simply trading the shares of the existing energy industry, which is what they do because all of these companies are led by traders right now, not by industry builders. We need new industry. In Europe, go to the pension funds directly, go to the insurance companies. The big mistake is we have long-term savers who put money in their pension funds, you know what the pension funds do? They put money into short-term money management. So we destroy the maturity of the financial system. You have long-term savers who end up investing in short-term assets, managed by short term traders whereas companies like yours should go to the pension funds directly and say &lsquo;help us finance a 30 year infrastructure project of clean energy&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t go to Goldman or someone else because all they&rsquo;ll do is trade short term, we&rsquo;ll do long-term financing and that&rsquo;s better for the pensioners because the pensioners right now are suffering terrible capital losses from the short-term trades of the hedge funds where you could be building a new long term industry and giving them good retirement returns, that&rsquo;s the way the world financial market should work but it doesn&rsquo;t work that way right now, it&rsquo;s become just infinitesimally short term and short-sighted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Moderator: Jeffery Sachs, thank you.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Professor Jeffrey D.

(141, 'Beginnerâ€™s guide to No Shampoo', 'eco&lifestyle', 'beauty', '', '', '', '<p><strong>Heard of the &lsquo;no poo&rsquo; or &lsquo;no shampoo&rsquo; movement? People across the world are dumping store-bought shampoo and conditioner in favour of making their own. Why bother? To free yourself from daily hair-washing; to reduce the toxic load on your body and on</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>the planet. And to save money. Aspen Aman investigates&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why would anyone want to give up shampoo? What&rsquo;s wrong with shampoo? This is a&nbsp;good question, especially for anyone who&rsquo;s already using organic and cruelty-free products in an effort to be as &lsquo;green&rsquo; and eco-conscious as possible. For a start, the environmental impact of going shampoo and conditioner-free is a compelling reason, since the product going down the drain is just baking soda and vinegar as opposed to a cocktail of chemicals that they need to be removed at the waste treatment plant in order for the water to be released back into the environment &ndash; this process takes huge amounts of water, not great when you live in a desert that already has huge challenges with water scarcity. Then there&rsquo;s the bazillions of tonnes of plastic waste generated by our global obsession with daily hair-washing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, a large no-poo movement is already gaining traction&nbsp;all over the world. These people have opted to forego shampoo and shampoo, instead making their own hair wash and conditioning products from the traditional cleansing ingredients your great-grandma used to use like baking soda &ndash; aka bicarbonate of soda, water and vinegar. You&rsquo;ll spend as much in a year as you would on one bottle of organic shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the environmental reasons, many &lsquo;no-poo&rsquo; or &lsquo;shampoo free&rsquo; converts also believe it&rsquo;s better for your health. Anything you put on your skin and scalp gets into your blood stream within seconds and from there it can be taken through your organs to every part of your body. That&rsquo;s why pregnant women stop dyeing their hair &ndash; for fear of their unborn child being harmed by colouring chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why else would you try no-poo? Some no-poo-ers say their hair got healthier, fuller and more vibrant than it was when they removed the artificial (and toxic)&nbsp;chemicals. Some people experience reduction of dandruff, psoriasis and other scalp issues when they go no-poo. Others report improved hair growth and reduced hair-fall since the scalp and hair follicles become healthier when chemical-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re not going to pretend it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;a challenge initially though. It takes at least 30 days for your hair to adjust to not being stripped of all its natural oils every day so for a while it will still pump out excessive amounts of oil &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get the greasies in other words but it&rsquo;s ok, there are natural remedies. Of course, if you try no-poo and don&rsquo;t like it, go back to your commercial shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO POO STARTER KIT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>So you&rsquo;re thinking about giving no-poo a try? Here&rsquo;s what you need:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Baking Soda (any brand will do) &bull; Distilled White Vinegar (fine/oily-prone hair) &bull; OR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Apple Cider Vinegar (curly/ dryness-prone hair)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Castile Soap (can buy at the Organic Supermarket)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Basic Equipment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A squeeze-bottle or old shampoo/ conditioner bottle for baking soda/ water cleanser</li>\r\n	<li>A good spray bottle for vinegar rinse</li>\r\n	<li>Measuring cup and some&nbsp;measuring spoons</li>\r\n	<li>A funnel for putting baking soda&nbsp;into squeeze bottle</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Helpful Stuff</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>A &lsquo;before&rsquo; picture showing the condition of your hair</li>\r\n	<li>Bathroom-safe (i.e. BPA-free plastic) storage containers for your baking soda and vinegar mixes</li>\r\n	<li>Spices like cinnamon sticks, star anise and/or vanilla pods for vinegar rinse</li>\r\n	<li>Essential oil (for very dry, not oily, tresses)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Basic Cleansing Formula (your homemade shampoo)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With no-poo, your new shampoo is basically just a mix of baking soda and water (filtered or mineral). The ratio is roughly one teaspoon of baking soda per cup (250mls) of water.&nbsp;Remember baking soda is NOT baking powder!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will end up playing around with this ratio in the first few weeks of no-poo. In the first few weeks of de-toxing, oily hair days, you&rsquo;ll probably want a higher proportion of baking soda to water mixture. Somewhere in about week three, you&rsquo;ll find that your hair may be trending towards dryness at the ends, which means you need to step down the ratio of baking soda to water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Squirt the baking soda/water cleanser mixture all along the hairline and on the crown of the head. These are the oiliest areas. Don&rsquo;t squirt the cleanser on the ends of the hair &ndash; it will dry them out. Gently massage the mixture into your hair and scalp. You will not get lather but may find your hair as a bit of a slippery feel to it. In all cases, rinsing well is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to how your hair feels each day during this detox transition&nbsp;period. Be prepared to experiment because this is a process of you getting your hair back to its natural state and learning what is best for your hair and preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expert Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Use Castile Soap (available at organic food stores in Dubai) diluted&nbsp;in water about once a week if you want to help cleanse the oily hair more thoroughly. In highly diluted ratios, this is a great solution for people with real oily scalp issues during the detox; also good if you have sweaty/dirty hair after a workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Basic Conditioning Formula</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember this little rule of thumb: Cleanser on the scalp and roots of hair, conditioner on the lengths and ends. Cleanser on the ends will dry your hair out over time (just like with commercial shampoo, by the way) and conditioner on the scalp will create oiliness/ heaviness (ditto for conditioner).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fine/Oily-prone hair: Distilled white vinegar and water &ndash; in a distilled solution. Try straight vinegar as a rinse, but will probably arrive at a highly diluted solution (mine is about 50/50 white vinegar/water solution) that smoothes the hair shaft after washing but doesn&rsquo;t weigh the hair down.Curly/dryness-prone hair: Apple&nbsp;cider vinegar and water &ndash; in a distilled solution. Just like the fine/oily-prone folks, you&rsquo;ll probably end up with a distilled solution but the ratio may be more like 70 per cent vinegar to 30 per cent water. But, like everything no-poo, you&rsquo;ll be learning what is best for your individual needs by trial and (few) errors. In both cases, finish off your hair with&nbsp;a cool/cold water rinse to close the hair cuticle. This reduces frizz and oiliness. Some people like adding a few drops of essential oil to their vinegar rinse to reduce the vinegar smell and give more moisture to the hair. Do this carefully as a little essential oil goes a long way in your hair. Also, your hair will not smell like vinegar with no-poo. Some people find a faint whiff of vinegar&nbsp;on day one and two but not longer, as your hair quickly adjusts to the vinegar rinse and doesn&rsquo;t absorb the odour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BATTLING THE GREASIES</strong>During the inevitable first month detox period of going no-poo when you&rsquo;re transitioning away from chemical-based shampoo/conditioner, your hair may get very oily. Here are a few tips on how to combat the greasies:1. Adjust the ratio of baking soda (aka bicarbonate of soda) to water in the cleansing solution. Start with one tablespoon baking soda to one cup water. If your hair is not getting clean, increase to roughly two tablespoons of baking soda to one cup of water. You should only need to have this higher ratio of baking soda for about two weeks while your hair is seriously detoxing and giving you the greasies.2. If you are desperate to combat severe greasies during the first week or two, try the baking soda paste method. Put a quantity of baking soda into your palm, add water and then rub into the scalp &ndash; especially around the hairline, over the ears and on the crown of the head where the scalp tends to get oiliest. Let the paste be an emergency remedy rather than your no-poo routine.3. Add a squirt of all-natural Castile soap in the baking soda/water solution for an extra shot of cleaning on the first week. You can adjust it to adding the squirt of Castile soap if/ when needed.4. If you have fine, limp or prone-to-oily hair, don&rsquo;t use the apple cider vinegar. Instead, use regular white vinegar. You may find that a ratio of 50:50 water/vinegar works for your hair &ndash; or even more diluted solutions of vinegar with water. Experiment until you find what works for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. As a general rule, people with oily or fine hair won&rsquo;t need to apply the vinegar rinse to the roots &ndash; especially during the greasies detox period. Use a spray bottle to spritz the vinegar rinse exactly where it is needed. Too much vinegar solution equals heavy, greasy hair at this stage of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Use the DIY dry shampoo as a touch-up later in the day if your hair is just too oily to tolerate. Cornstarch is better for light coloured hair while a cocoa/cornstarch mix is better for darker hair. The cornstarch/cocoa is a 1:1 ratio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Experiment: You&rsquo;ll need to note (mentally or by writing down your notes) how your hair is reacting to the baking soda/water cleanser and the vinegar rinse &ndash; and just give yourself a few weeks to get through this stage by playing around with the solutions and the dry shampoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHEMICAL NASTIES IN YOUR SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brief overview of some of the most commonly-used chemicals in commercial shampoos and conditioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, a.k.a. SLS and SLES: These are&nbsp;the foaming agents that make you think your hair is clean even though the foam does not do any cleaning. SLS/SLES have been linked to carcinogenic activity in the body and can also cause genetic mutation, skin/eye irritation and disruption of the body&rsquo;s endocrine system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Parabens: This is a whole family of chemicals ending with the suffix &lsquo;paraben&rsquo;. Parabens have been described as &ldquo;estrogen mimicker&rdquo; which means that they send signals to the body that is similar to estrogen, which can lead to hormonal imbalances in women and men as well as increased risk of some cancers. Look for methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben or any other chemical ending in &lsquo;paraben&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Quaternium-15: A preservative that releases formaldehyde into the body. Quaternium-15 is linked to cancers like leukemia and is also an allergen and can cause contact dermatitis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Fragrance: While this sounds harmless enough &ndash; even appealing &ndash; the catch-all phrase &lsquo;fragrance&rsquo; or its even nicer-sounding cousin &lsquo;parfum&rsquo; covers over 4,000 different chemicals used in personal care products. Many of these are petroleum- based, have been linked to cancer and can cause rashes/allergic reactions and headaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Methylisothiazolinone: This unpronounceable ingredient is often shortened to MIT on a label. It has been shown to cause neurological damage &ndash; especially in fetuses &ndash; and has been linked to Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For specific information on what toxic or otherwise harmful chemicals are in your&nbsp;favourite personal grooming products, consult the Skin Deep Cosmetics database by the Environmental Working Group at www.ewg.org/skindeep.</p>\r\n', 'shampoo-hair-lady-extended-1024x541.jpg', '2019-07-28 06:34:12');

From falcons to puppies, fish, reptiles, monkeys, horses, cats and wild animals &ndash; a little energy healing goes a long way. &nbsp;Words by Tamara Pitelen.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who believe in energy healing, physical and mental illness are the manifestations&nbsp;of unresolved emotional issues. For example, energy healers believe that diseases like cancer can be the result of an inability to receive love due to perhaps a subconscious belief of not being worthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing these emotional root causes of disease is the purpose of healing modalities such as Theta healing, Hypnotherapy, Reiki, Pranic healing, Spiritual Response Therapy and other energetic based therapies.<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s not just humans who manifest illness as a result of unresolved emotional issues though, Dubai-based Reiki healer Sabine Poncelet believes many of the problems animals have are often the result of their own feelings&nbsp;of abandonment, jealousy, neglect, or lack of love. In addition she says, our pets are also a sponge for our negative emotions and feelings.&ldquo;Reiki is energy, ultimately. It&rsquo;s a life force energy and when your energy is not in balance you can get sick,&rdquo; Poncelet says.&ldquo;Your chakras are energy centres. The best example is your solar plexus chakra, which is linked mainly to all your digestive organs. When you have a stomach ulcer, even a traditional doctor will tell you, &lsquo;reduce your stress&rsquo;.&ldquo;When your energy centres are not balanced, you develop problems. It&rsquo;s the same with animals but more so&nbsp;because people transfer their energies to their pets. When you touch or stroke an animal, you may not realise it but you are transferring your energy and emotions. Animals are like a sponge in that way, so are young children.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BORN INTUITIVE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally from from Belgium, Poncelet has been in Dubai since 2011. For more than 15 years she was a financial controller before becoming a full-time Reiki and energy healer for humans and animals. She knew&nbsp;at the age of seven that she had a&nbsp;natural talent for healing and could communicate with animals but it wasn&rsquo;t until she healed her own daughter with Reiki that she devoted herself fully to energy healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was very intuitive. When I put my hands on people with pain or injuries, they disappeared. I could communicate with animals too; I could feel what they were thinking. I also knew things in advance but my mother said to me, &lsquo;oh it&rsquo;s just your imagination, forget about this&hellip;&rsquo; so of course I believed her and for a long time I didn&rsquo;t use my abilities like I use them now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As she got older though, Poncelet started researching healing modalities like Reiki and Magnetism. She studied Reiki initially in Europe as she found it was the modality that offered the best explanation for her natural gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HANDS ON HEALING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poncelet&rsquo;s first major success was&nbsp;when her own daughter was born with gastric reflux. She was aged 24 and her newborn baby could not hold milk down because the valve at the bottom of her esophagus would not close. So, she would vomit everything back up, which caused major internal inflammation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She was just one month old when my doctor told me she would have to be on medication for six years but that this would not heal her, the medication would only reduce the symptoms,&rdquo; Poncelet said. &ldquo;I would have tried anything so I put my hands on her in the place she had the pain.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next two years, Poncelet gave her daughter the doctor&rsquo;s medication but she also gave her regular Reiki healing sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After two years I stopped the medication because she was fully healed &ndash; something the doctor said would never happen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that, Poncelet studied more energy healing modalities and worked on family and friends with wonderful results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For 20 years, I was working more on people than animals and initially I only worked on my own animals but later on, when I was about 36, I started working on the animals of my friends in Belgium. Mostly on dogs, cats and horses.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DOG DEMENTIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animals are very sensitive to energy, Poncelet says, and often respond very well to Reiki and energy healing. She says the issues pets can be caused</p>\r\n\r\n<p>by the owner &ndash; not all the time but<br />\r\nit happens. As in the case with a Pekinese dog she worked on recently who suffered from panic attacks, anxiety, sleeplessness and dementia.<br />\r\nIn his crazed episodes, he would run straight into walls and his owners were at a loss as to how to help him, they were considering euthanasia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Geordie is 13 years old and after six Reiki sessions he is now fine but when the owner called me, this dog was in a terrible state, he was crazy. It was my first case of dementia and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do but when I touched him to do the Reiki, I discovered that he was very linked to this woman, his owner. Some dogs are more independent, less sensitive but this dog was soul-linked to her. The dog was like her baby and of course the dog can feel this so he was emotionally involved in the woman&rsquo;s troubles. She had a lot&nbsp;of problems in her life so she was very stressed and depressed. Unfortunately, her dog took on her troubles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At first, I didn&rsquo;t expect a great result because I didn&rsquo;t know the origin of the dementia, but when I discovered the origin was in the dog/owner relationship and the dog was having panic attacks because of the owner&rsquo;s troubles, I thought &lsquo;ok, now I&rsquo;ve got the root&rsquo;. The illness is the consequence of the root trouble. You have to get the root and sometimes it&rsquo;s completely different to the illness.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the owner understood this, she began making changes in her life, Poncelet says. &ldquo;Since the Reiki, Geordie</p>\r\n\r\n<p>has been much better, the owner sent me a message last week saying, &lsquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s wonderful, I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you. We&rsquo;re doing so much better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HORSE PLAY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like humans, animals suffer from emotional stress and physical illness but some animals are more sensitive than others, Poncelet says. Dolphins are the most sensitive animals on Earth followed by horses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we use horses to work with autistic children because they&nbsp;are able to understand certain things, when you speak with a horse &ndash; not like speaking with a human &ndash; you have the feeling that he understands you. I can&rsquo;t explain it, it&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She tells the story of another recent canine client, a chihuahua that was dying from a cancerous tumour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This chihuahua was at the end of her life when the woman called me, there was not much I could do other than relieve the animal&rsquo;s suffering in its final days. That first session was 90 minutes long, normally a session is about 30 minutes to an hour but this little dog was sucking in the energy she needed. I asked the dog what happened and how she was feeling, she communicated with me she was feeling depressed, and sad. She told me that since her owner&rsquo;s baby was born, she had felt rejected. The dog told me, &lsquo;she didn&rsquo;t look at me anymore; I was abandoned like I was nothing&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;After the session, I asked the owner when the cancer had developed and she said, &lsquo;after my baby was born, maybe nine months to a year later&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe cancer is the result a lack of love, especially for humans. It can manifest because you cannot express your love or you don&rsquo;t know how to receive love, it&rsquo;s linked. For animals it is the same, in this case especially.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chihuahua died four days later but the owner&rsquo;s feedback was that, after the Reiki session, the dog was much more peaceful and the relationship between the dog and the woman was better so the little dog passed away&nbsp;in peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THOUGHTS ARE ENERGY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Poncelet would like people to understand is that their emotions can affect their pets and that the pet&rsquo;s own feelings contribute to physical and mental ailments, this could be sadness, rejection, abandonment, neglect, etc&nbsp;and could be caused by anything from a new animal or baby being brought into the house to old trauma from abuse or neglect from their early life. Even if an animal is now in a loving home, it may have psychological issues stemming from early ill treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I believe your illnesses start with your thoughts because your body reacts to your thoughts. It is all just energy that flows through the meridians and chakras of your body and into your organs. It&rsquo;s the same thing for animals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Poncelet, seeing her animal clients become happier, healthier little creatures after a few sessions of energy healing gives her great joy and satisfaction.&nbsp;Poncelet hopes that one day it will be commonplace to combine alternative and complementary therapy with traditional veterinarian practice as well as with allopathic medicine for humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UAE, this is not usual&nbsp;yet but in the US, Reiki is now commonplace in hospitals with many patients opting for a Reiki session before surgery. In Japan, Theta healing is being used in hospitals&nbsp;and in Germany and Switzerland,&nbsp;a Reiki consultation and treatment&nbsp;is refunded under your health insurance policy, as long as the Reiki practitioner is certified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We owe so much to the animals in our lives,&rdquo; Sabine says. &ldquo;Animals teach us a lot of things including, how to be committed, how to&nbsp;love unconditionally, and how to receive love because they love you unconditionally, all animals without any exception.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PET OWNERS&rsquo; FEEDBACK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We spoke to some of the people who&rsquo;ve taken their troubled pets to Sabine Poncelet for Reiki healing, here&rsquo;s what they said:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cat: Hippie, age 4<br />\r\nHuman: Lucie Fonseca, Dubai<br />\r\nIssue: Hippie wouldn&rsquo;t accept a new cat into the house.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Hippie was rescued from the streets of Abu Dhabi when she was about a year old. When she came to us, she was very scared and jumpy. She was also afraid of other cats. Whenever there was another cat around, she would become obsessed by it, stalk and growl all the time, stop eating, stop sleeping, stop purring. She would be very stressed. In April this year, we decided to adopt a new cat, Pepper. We asked Sabine to do a Reiki treatment on Hippie to help her deal with the stress of the other cat in the house. We did one session before the two cats were introduced and one after. The results were brilliant. After the treatments, Hippie accepted Pepper really fast. One week after the second Reiki treatment, we were able to leave the two cats together without supervision and there were no fights. They did not become best friends but they co-exist peacefully. I think Sabine&rsquo;s intervention helped Hippie feel relaxed and secure so she didn&rsquo;t feel the need to show aggression and the introduction was a success.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horse: Prince, age four and a half<br />\r\nHuman: Vicky Remy, Belgium<br />\r\nIssue: Prince was losing weight and refusing to eat<br />\r\nNot long after we bought Prince in 2008, he virtually stopped eating despite no physical problem and the vet didn&rsquo;t know why.<br />\r\nHe lost a lot of weight, we were very&nbsp;worried. After the first Reiki session,&nbsp;we could see he was feeling better,&nbsp;he started to smell his food and nibble&nbsp;small portions. Sabine said the horse&nbsp;was feeling very sad because he had lost&nbsp;a much loved family member. After the two&nbsp;sessions he was eating normally again&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ve never had this problem&nbsp;with him since. Sometime&nbsp;later, we found out from&nbsp;the previous owners&nbsp;that Prince had lost his&nbsp;mate not long before&nbsp;we got him. Sabine&nbsp;completely surpassed<br />\r\nour expectations; we&nbsp;are very grateful.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TRIED AND TESTED BY JAKE THE AWAKENINGS CAT</strong><br />\r\n<em>Can Reiki really help pets be happier and healthier? Awakenings wanted to find out so we took animal Reiki healer Sabine Poncelet home to give our cat, Jake, a health check.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we asked Sabine to come over to our house and give our two-year-old cat Jake a check up, we honestly thought there was nothing wrong with him. Apart from a little limping from a hip operation he&rsquo;d had about 12 months earlier, he seemed fine. How wrong we were!<br />\r\nSabine came over and after a 10 minute body scan of Jake and a chat with him via his higher self, we were surprised to be told that he was feeling intense pain around his teeth and jaw area and that the parasites in his small intestine were out of control which was giving him an upset stomach. We had to admit he was long overdue a de-worming treatment.<br />\r\n&ldquo;Take him to vet to check,&rdquo; Sabine said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is causing the pain around his teeth and jaws but he tells me it is intense and he cannot cope with it, he has asked for help. &ldquo;As for the hip, he says this doesn&rsquo;t really bother him, only sometimes, he can cope with<br />\r\nit. A joint supplement would help though.&rdquo;<br />\r\nSo Sabine gave Jake some Reiki to suppress the pain for a while and we took Jake to the vet a couple of days later. Sure enough, the vet tells us that Jake has a severe ear infection caused by ear mites and that it would be causing him a lot of pain. We then remembered he had been scratching his ears a lot lately, we&rsquo;d even mentioned it a couple of weeks earlier.<br />\r\nBy the next day, it was obvious even to us that Jake was in a huge amount of pain and discomfort but at least we&rsquo;d started him on medication for the ear infection. It was heart-breaking to see him in so much pain so we got Sabine back in to do a full Reiki session on him. He communicated with her that the pain was now consuming his whole head.<br />\r\nShe worked on him for about 30 minutes and he seemed slightly better immediately. Within 24 hours, he was noticeably better. We&rsquo;re extremely grateful to Sabine for her help with Jake. It was also interesting to hear some of the other things he had to say as well, for example, apparently<br />\r\nhe gets bored sometimes and he doesn&rsquo;t feel very confident about facing up to other cats in the neighbourhood. So, we&rsquo;re going to get another cat to be his companion, a very young female, Sabine advises, and we&rsquo;ll get him a Reiki session to work on his confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>ï¿¼SABINE PONCELET is the founder of Animal Reiki Dubai, as well as dogs and cats, she works with falcons, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and wild animals.

Why not?&nbsp;<em>Awakenings</em>reporter Adrian Maul investigates the what, why, where and how much of green cars in the UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year, air pollution kills about seven million people globally. This is more than the combined death toll of diseases such as malaria and AIDS that are devastating parts of the world. [Source: World Health Organisation.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In China, being the &lsquo;Asian Tiger&rsquo; has left people living in cities in which they can barely breathe.&nbsp; In 2010, 1.2 million deaths in China were attributed to air pollution [<em>Financial Times</em>]. The price of that country&rsquo;s incredible economic growth and industrialisation in recent years is being paid economically and socially. China has realised things must change and is now tackling its environmental challenges with its usual ferocity and is aggressively putting measures in place to reduce its carbon footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here in the UAE, air pollution is responsible for an estimated 850 deaths a year, according to a study commissioned by the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi. [October 2009,&nbsp;<em>The National</em>]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The greatest risk is outdoors, where residents are exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone smog and particulate matter,&rdquo; the newspaper reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAE authorities understand the issues with air pollution and the government is taking steps to minimise the problems by monitoring air pollution and introducing legislation to cut emissions. Progress though appears minimal at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FUEL SCARCITY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eco-friendly cars are a relatively modern concept stemming back to the 1970s when a worldwide fuel shortage resulted in smaller, more economical cars being designed and produced. Through history however there have been other times when it has been necessary to produce more efficient cars, such as after the Second World War, again as a result of fuel shortages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially all efforts were driven towards fuel savings due to the scarcity of fuel and its rising cost. The true drive towards eco-friendly cars was not until the late 1990&rsquo;s when the impact of pollution and greenhouse gasses on the environment and ozone layer became widely reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eco friendly cars today are considered those that are economical, have low pollutant emissions and a relatively low impact on the environment through their manufacture and disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today the manufacture and disposal of most modern cars is vastly improved from previous years, about three quarters of a modern car can now be recycled. This means that probably 80 to 90 per cent of a car&rsquo;s environmental impact nowadays is as a result of fuel consumption and emissions of air pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GAS, DIESEL OR PETROL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what fuel options are there? The obvious are petrol and diesel but nowadays, alternative fuels such as Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) are becoming more commonly available for cars throughout the world. In 2012 the Executive Council in Abu Dhabi decreed that 25 per cent of taxis had to be converted to CNG, and a number of filling stations now supply CNG across the UAE. The other alternatives of course are electric vehicles (EV) and many manufacturers are now mass-producing electric or hybrid cars (hybrid cars have a combination of electric motors and internal combustion engines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard petrol and diesel cars are fairly well known. They impact the environment by using up diminishing fossil fuels as well as emitting air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NO) and particulate matter. Modern petrol cars are fitted with catalytic converters which significantly reduce the CO, HC and NO emissions at the expense of producing more carbon dioxide (Co2). Diesel cars tend to have slightly less impact on the environment than their modern petrol counterparts simply because the cars are more fuel efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For cars powered by CNG, emissions of carbon dioxide are similar to diesel vehicles, but outperform petrol. NO and particulate emissions are also significantly less than petrol engines; however, hydrocarbons are higher due to the methane in CNG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SOMETHING IN THE AIR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>in sum, petrol engines in cars, buses, trains and planes emit deadly greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide&nbsp;and volatile organic compounds. This is air pollution and it&rsquo;s why residents of cities like Dubai live our lives permanently shrouded in a brownish haze of poison-filled air. Overseas, the issue has prompted more uptake of less environmentally harmful vehicles and in some global cities, electric and hybrid cars are now commonplace. Invariably, this is in countries where governments are actively encouraging their citizens to adopt &lsquo;green&rsquo; cars via incentives such as grants and tax rebates. For example, in the UK, buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) get a grant of 25 per cent of the car&rsquo;s value up to GBP 5,000 as well as exemption from car tax and congestion charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just as well for the green car industry because EVs can be up to 80 per cent more expensive to buy than their combustion engine counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UAE, we have neither the incentive of high petrol prices nor government incentives therefore &ndash; assuming you had the option &ndash; buying an EV can be an expensive choice and the running costs of electric vehicles will likely be higher until such time as the initial purchase prices become much more comparable. This is part of the reason for why you don&rsquo;t see electric cars on Sheikh Zayed Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHERE&rsquo;S THE PLUG?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of uptake in the UAE isn&rsquo;t just about fuel prices though. Another major disincentive is the lack of infrastructure such as battery recharge stations to support electric and hybrid vehicles. Many residents in the UAE live in high-rise flats without access to garaging for their cars. This means that without government-provided or private sector-provided infrastructure, EVs and Plug in Hybrids (PIVs) are limited to those people who live in villas with garaged or off-road parking available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US and many European countries are embracing the drive towards more environmentally friendly cars and are putting infrastructure in place in larger towns to support EVs and PIVs. Even the UAE has one such recharge power point near the Financial Centre Metro Station in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GREEN CARS UAE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for those people in the UAE for whom price and power recharging is not an issue, what range of electric or hybrid vehicles are available? Interestingly, most options are at the luxury or high-end range, with brands like Porsche and Fisker Karma leading the way. This comes down to some simple facts like wealthier people tend to live in villas so there is somewhere to recharge the electric battery, as opposed to high-rise apartment owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For electric vehicle buyers &ndash; as opposed to hybrid buyers &ndash; the UAE offers almost nothing. I was not able to find a single supplier apart from Al Futtaim that offers a luxury hybrid, the Fisker Karma at a price of AED 560,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Karma is an extended range EV with the option of a petrol engine to provide power to the electric motor; so it&rsquo;s more of a hybrid than a true EV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hybrids are more versatile then pure EVs since they can recharge their batteries from their engines and tend to have a greater range. Many manufacturers now produce hybrids including Renault, Toyota, Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, Peugeot, Volkswagon, Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche. Of all these manufacturers, only Lexus and Porsche offer their hybrids in the UAE. Of the rest, only BMW is prepared to special order a hybrid car for a customer. The resounding reason I was told by the companies regarding why they do not offer a green range was the lack of charging infrastructure available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Porsche sold a total of 9,171 cars across the region, of which 192 since 2010 were hybrids. Why do Porsche offer hybrids to UAE customers in contrast to almost all other car manufacturers? Managing Director for Porsche Middle East and Africa George Wills said: &ldquo;We believe our customers should have access to the entire model range, including our hybrid offers. We don&rsquo;t follow the general trend, we want to set it. It is important to start building up the awareness and confidence in customers for hybrid models in this region; only through this, the general acceptance will increase.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wills acknowledged the uphill battle however: &ldquo;In comparison to Europe, we have less external factors influencing the consumer buying decision, such as petrol costs, tax benefits, emission standards or a well-planned charging infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECO SHOPPERS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wills says that most people who buy hybrid cars are well aware of the benefits before they buy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Some are looking for an alternative to a classic combustion engine to fulfil their overall lifestyle decision of creating the least impact on the environment and use available resources in the most efficient way. However, we have also noticed that other customers see themselves as role models for others, by showcasing the convenience and reliability of modern hybrid vehicles.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wills says he is confident this trend towards greener cars will continue in the coming years although education is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is a demand for educating the regional audience on environmental friendly drives and eliminate potential prejudices, for example the life expectancy of a battery, high voltage lines in a car and service intervals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our brand is ready for the challenge with an attractive model line-up. There is a lot of talk these days about hybrids in our region but we should not forget that also cars with a standard combustion engine develop further and feature a variety of fuel and emission reducing measures nowadays.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As hybrid and electric cars become more established elsewhere in the world, chances are the UAE is almost certain to follow. Many road users drive short distances within the cities so EV range is not be an issue. In addition, the UAE&rsquo;s hot climate offers a massive resource for recharging them roadside if solar power stations are introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harnessing the power of the sun with roadside charging stations that are already being used in other countries as park and charge units seems a viable solution for the region. It would only take a local entrepreneur to accept the challenge of driving the infrastructure and the UAE could be one of the highest users of hybrid and electric vehicle&rsquo;s in the world thereby vastly reducing its carbon footprint and drastically improving its air quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHAT IS A GREEN CAR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eco-friendly cars are fuel-efficient, have low pollutant emissions and a relatively low impact on the environment through their manufacture and disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s, efforts to make cars more fuel-efficient were motivated by the worldwide fuel shortage and its rising cost. It wasn&rsquo;t until the late 1990s that an environmental motivation was sparked by the realisation of how much damage pollution and greenhouse gasses were doing to the environment and earth&rsquo;s ozone layer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today the manufacture and disposal of most modern cars is vastly improved from previous years, about three quarters of a modern car can now be recycled. This means that 80 to 90 per cent of a car&rsquo;s environmental impact is now a result of fuel consumption and air pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially it was thought that the environmental impact of producing and subsequently disposing of large volumes of batteries for electric cars would have a significant impact to their environmental footprint. This was widely overestimated and in fact the battery production and disposal only contributes towards approximately 15 per cent of the environmental footprint for the car, a large portion of which is attributed to sourcing and processing the raw materials such as cobalt, nickel and copper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other aspect of electric cars is the impact of producing the electricity to recharge the batteries when you plug them in. In the UAE, most power plants are natural gas, which produces about half the carbon dioxide and a third less nitrogen oxides than oil and coal-fired power plants. Ironically, the UK and US are two of the countries with the greatest uptake of green cars yet both of them have large numbers of coal-fuelled power stations, therefore significantly reducing many of the benefits for electric vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Hybrids</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine, the drive can be either completely electric, completely engine or a combination of the two. The batteries can be recharged by the internal combustion engine or, most efficiently, through energy absorbed through braking. Some hybrids can also be plugged into mains supply to charge the batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Plug In Vehicle (PIV) hybrids</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cars that can plug into electric charging points to recharge their batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Electric cars</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Need connecting to electric charging points to recharge their batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bull; Hydrogen Cell cars&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Powered via an electric motor that&rsquo;s recharged using a hydrogen cell. New to the market, these are very rare and expensive. The only waste product from a hydrogen cell is water making these extremely eco-friendly, however producing the hydrogen fuel is not!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHAT WILL A GREEN CAR COST YOU IN THE UAE?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Porsche&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe UAE winner &ndash; no other manufacturer is pushing the green envelope in the UAE as much as Porsche. In the UAE, Porsche offers the Cayenne S Hybrid, Panamera S Hybrid and Panamera S E-Hybrid. The world&rsquo;s first plug-in hybrid in the luxury class, the Panamera S E-Hybrid&rsquo;s fuel consumption is 3.1 litres per 100km and reaches a speed of up to 135 km/h in pure electric drive mode.

This vehicle was intended for competition use, and Ferdinand Porsche himself delivered it to the purchaser, E.W. Hart, who lived in Luton, north of London, England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with public demand and the challenge of smelly steam vehicles and internal combustion engines, the Austrian Dr. Ferdinand Porsche invented an electric wheel hub in 1896 to power the world&rsquo;s first front-wheel-drive car. This car had a range of around 65 km/h. To increase its range, Porsche later added an internal combustion engine to spin a generator that provided power to electric motors located in the wheel hubs. Thus the hybrid was invented in around 1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lohner-Porsche electric car, powered by wheel-hub motors, caused a sensation at the Paris world trade fair in 1900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lohner-Porsche electric car, a &ldquo;Chaise&rdquo; with the internal vehicle number 24000, was exhibited as the only Austrian car at the 1900 Paris World&rsquo;s Fair. A news report at the time described the development of the first-ever transmissionless vehicle as a revolutionary innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The electric motors in the hubs of the front wheels had an output of 2.5 horsepower at 120 rpm. The 44-cell, 80-volt rechargeable battery with a capacity of 300 ampere-hours gave the car a range of 50 kilometres between recharges; the maximum speed was 50 kilometres per hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slow speed of the electric motor permitted direct drive and installation in the wheel. The motor operated without chains and thus without mechanical power loss. Consequently, the electric motor was extremely efficient and was almost silent during operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total weight of the vehicle was 1,205 kg. The car could be braked at all four wheels &ndash; by the motors at the front axle and with the aid of a mechanical strap brake at the rear axle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW FAST ARE GREEN CARS?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A need for speed is no longer a reason to dismiss electric cars. Earlier this year, the current electric land speed record of 328 km/h was set by Britain&rsquo;s Lord Drayson. The very first electric land speed record of 63 km/h was set in 1898 by Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'green-car-blue-sky-1024x682.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:44:41'),
(144, 'Baby on the way? Dial a doula to help you through', 'eco&lifestyle', 'body', 'mums-and-babies', '', '', '<p><em><strong>Midwives, doctors, loved ones? Who else would you have sharing one of the biggest events of your life: the birth of your baby? Yoga instructor and new mother Cheryl Parsons hired a doula to be with her on delivery day. She reveals more about this growing trend in alternative birthing support&hellip;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can hear your first question already. What on earth is a doula and what were they doing at one of the most&nbsp;intimate days of my life? Somewhat unfortunately named, the word&nbsp;&lsquo;doula&rsquo; derives from the Greek word for a female servant. Now while that might conjure up images of someone feeding me grapes and fanning me down during contractions, I can assure you this wasn&rsquo;t the case. A doula is a non-medical birthing support partner who is there to assist a woman before, during and after childbirth. Above all, they aim to create a positive birthing experience. In my case, my doula was a huge support throughout 22 hours&nbsp;of labour for the birth of my first baby, Molly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COUNTDOWN TO SHOW TIME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My husband and I where just getting into bed last July when, five days past my due date, I felt those all important twinges signaling it was show time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a first-timer like I was,&nbsp;you will ask yourself questions such as: &lsquo;how will I know this is actually happening&rsquo; and &lsquo;what on earth I am supposed to do next?&rsquo; All that and more buzzed through my mind as I picked up the phone to call my doula, Carol Unterhorst, who we had both met with several times in the lead up to &lsquo;D&rsquo; day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had first heard about doulas during my pre-natal yoga teacher training and was intrigued about the thought of bringing someone with me, in addition to the medical team. While healthcare in Dubai is for the most part excellent, I wanted someone extra to help advocate my plan for a natural birth wherever possible, especially given my distance as an expatriate from my core family support. I went along to a monthly meeting of some of Dubai&rsquo;s doulas and instantly felt this was something that would help me feel empowered during my birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as guiding me through the unchartered territory of my first birth, I knew a doula would also give my slightly nervous husband some additional support as to what role&nbsp;he could play. Plus, despite feeling well prepared by my continuous yoga practice, fear was still a major factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;To me, the natural birthing process is a miraculous spiritual experience&nbsp;and it is the reason why I decided to become a doula,&rdquo; explains Carol, who is certified through the Nurturing Birth, an organisation that provides extensive training in the UK and the UAE. &ldquo;Being a doula means I can share and support women to help them achieve a positive birth. Fear is such a big thing in childbirth and it is often manifested&nbsp;through a lack of knowledge, so a key part of being a doula is to ensure the best educational materials are shared with parents to be. As an expat I also truly understand the need for a solid support structure around you especially at one of the most important events of your life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PLEASURE, PAIN AND PUSHING</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prenatal vinyasa yoga instructor Jennifer (Wolfe) More also became a doula&nbsp;after the birth of her daughter 14 years ago. She now trains doulas worldwide through her organisation, the Dolphin Yoga and Doula Center. &ldquo;I remember expecting that labour was going to be much easier for me than all of the stories I&rsquo;d heard,&rdquo; Jennifer says. &ldquo;After all I was&nbsp;a yoga instructor and a hypnotherapist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten days after my due date, I found myself in the hospital, hooked up to an IV and being pumped full of medication that was supposed to start my labour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That first night in the hospital a nurse came and asked me if I&rsquo;d like a massage and a warm bath,&rdquo; Jennifer says. &ldquo;Those two things, in that moment, were the most pleasurable things I had ever experienced. They kept me going through my 33 hours of labour and three hours of pushing. I&rsquo;ll never forget sitting in a rocking chair after 30 hours and thinking to myself, &lsquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do for the rest of my life. I&rsquo;m going to help people get through this very moment.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve spent the last 13 years doing just that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A doula&rsquo;s role in childbirth is certainly not to replace or take away from that of a midwife or doctor. Indeed, while doulas are meticulously trained in childbirth, they do not have the authority to take medical action or make medical decisions. Their key services are to give educational, psychological and emotional support both before&nbsp;and during the birthing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Being a doula has to be one of the most gratifying jobs in the world. As&nbsp;a doula we witness not only the birth&nbsp;of a new life into the world, which is magical and beautiful but we also get to walk with women through the journey of becoming a mother,&rdquo; says Jennifer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EMPOWER AND UPLIFT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having this extra core support and help to make informed decisions at such a highly emotional and physical time is one of the main reasons why women turn to doulas. Mother of two Jane Caen also chose Carol as her doula for her second birth: &ldquo;I felt that I was pushed into a totally unnecessary Cesarean Section (CS) with my previous pregnancy by being &lsquo;advised&rsquo; that this was &lsquo;the next step&rsquo; and that it was &lsquo;best for the baby,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I also fell pregnant only three months after my son was born and was determined to have a natural and drug free birth. I saw several OBs but only one was prepared to let me have a natural birth so close to my c-sec operation. I wanted to have someone with me with experience of labour&nbsp;to ensure I would not be railroaded back down the CS route by baffling&nbsp;and frightening warnings of how dangerous it was for the baby,&rdquo; Jane said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It took the stress and pressure off. Just knowing Carol was there helped my labour flow from one stage to the next more naturally. Her presence took away my worry that this could all end in a CS again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While doulas help to advocate a natural, medication-free birth, they are respectful and supporting of&nbsp;every woman&rsquo;s right to have the birth she wants, be that with or without medication. With my own birthing experience clocking in at 22 hours, I credit my strength to the support of my husband and Carol, as well as my wonderful OBGYN, Dr. Rajalakshmi at the American Hospital.

(147, 'My first sÃ©ance', 'body', 'mediumship', 'mediumship', '', '', '<p><em>If you think a s&eacute;ance is all quiet and spooky, think again. In&nbsp;</em>My First Seance<em>, Tamara Pitelen reveals that sitting in a s&eacute;ance can be like going to a nightclub that has a kindergarten in the corner. There&rsquo;s music, laughter, lots of noise&hellip; and of course plenty of dead people.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I may have just chatted with a dead person for the very first time. I don&rsquo;t mean an imaginary discussion in my head. This was an out-loud, two-way conversation with a dead person &ndash; or to put it less bluntly, a person from spirit world. My dead conversationalist was Daniel, a Cockney boy of about nine years old. More on what we talked about in a second; first, let me backtrack to explain how I ended up sitting with a group of people trying to communicate with the dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IS THERE ANYBODY THERE?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before tonight, I&rsquo;d thought a s&eacute;ance involved very serious people sitting quietly round a table earnestly asking, &lsquo;is there anybody there?&rsquo; in a spooky voice. Turns out it&rsquo;s more like going to a nightclub that has a kindergarten in the corner. There&rsquo;s a lot of music, laughter, banter and noise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s suspend disbelief for a moment and accept that what I perceived was real. If so, I had spirit children spray me with water from a little water pistol and I watched as these spirit children played with fluorescent toys, making them seemingly dance by themselves in the darkness. These little spirit children also stood (or hovered) at my knee, serenading me as only a six-year-old with a drum can. All ear-splitting vigour, not much rhythm. The spirit children in our midst bashed away on toy pianos, blew harmonicas, banged drums, and rang bells as loudly as they could. Meanwhile myself and about 40 other people sat on chairs in a big circle, all holding hands and singing at the top of our voices along with the child musicians. We belted out songs by Abba, Bon Jovi, One Direction, The Carpenters, Don McLean, Louis Armstrong, Tina Turner and more. Why? The idea is that all the loud singing both lifts our vibrations and raises the energy in the room, which makes it easier for the spirit people to come into our reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOGWARTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The s&eacute;ance I just attended was part of a week-long mediumship training course at the Arthur Findlay College for the Advancement of Psychic Studies in Stansted, London. Yes, it is like being a boarder at Hogwarts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what happens at a s&eacute;ance and how does it happen? First, you need a physical medium. This is a person who has the ability to allow spirit people to use his or her body to have a presence in this world &ndash; that presence can be heard or seen by everyone present, whether they have psychic abilities or not. I can vouch for the fact that everyone of the 40 or so people in the s&eacute;ance &ndash; aka &lsquo;sitters&rsquo; &ndash; could hear the spirit people talk and sing and play the various instruments that had been left out for them to play with. The physical medium at the Arthur Findlay College is Scott Milligan, 31, who&rsquo;s been working as a physical medium for about 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole process took about four hours. The first half hour was the preparation lecture where we all sat in another room and Scott told us what we might expect as well as the dos and don&rsquo;ts. It is a very serious business, this s&eacute;ance sitting. If sitters don&rsquo;t follow the rules, the medium can be seriously hurt, even killed. Why is it dangerous? Because we&rsquo;re all energetically linked during a s&eacute;ance and he can effectively be burnt or electrocuted. Scott described it as if he was at the centre of a spider&rsquo;s web and each of us were at the outside end of a strand. Any movement at the outer edge of the web vibrated through to the centre. He told us about a good friend of his, also a physical medium, who couldn&rsquo;t eat for two weeks after his esophagus was burnt at a s&eacute;ance where a sitter stood up suddenly, jerked forward and vomited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common question is, why does the s&eacute;ance have to take place in total darkness? In this case, it&rsquo;s because of the level of Scott&rsquo;s development as a physical medium. His aim is to eventually be able to hold a s&eacute;ance in the light and to advance to the point where spirit people can actually manifest in solid form through him but he&rsquo;s not ready for that yet and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hold a deep trance state for up to three hours with all the lights on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FRAUD POLICE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is quite a procedure to go through before the s&eacute;ance commences. This is to counter any &lsquo;hoax&rsquo; accusations before they come. Of course though, such accusations are inevitable no matter what lengths the mediums go to to show it&rsquo;s all real.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, two &lsquo;independents&rsquo; are chosen from our group &ndash; it&rsquo;s their job to uncover any fraudulent behaviour. For example, they must check the s&eacute;ance room for anything suspicious, like a team of actors hiding behind the curtain or hidden doors, as well as check the chair to which the medium gets tied. Then they actually tie him to the chair with plastic fasteners and throughout the evening, they check he&rsquo;s still securely fastened. The independents cut the ends of the plastic ties off when they&rsquo;ve secured Scott and they keep them in their pockets for verification that, at the end of the s&eacute;ance, the ties on Scott&rsquo;s wrists and ankles are the same ones as at the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the duration of the s&eacute;ance, Scott is strapped to the chair by his hands, arms, feet and legs, all to prove he could not be manipulating anything. Unless he has Houdini-like talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The independents are chosen during the preparation speech. Scott asks two people to stand with their backs to the group and throw a scrunched up paper ball over their shoulders at the class in the same way a bride would throw her bouquet. Whoever catches the paper balls are the independents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we moved into the s&eacute;ance room, which in this case is the Arthur Findlay College library, a large room lined with a circle of chairs. Before we can go in though, we are frisked. You may take nothing into the room other than the clothes you&rsquo;re wearing. No phones, no jewellery apart from wedding rings, no bags, etc. Shoes are left at the door</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even where you sit in the room is decided by lucky draw. Each chair has a slip of paper with a number on it. A bucket contains a pile of slips with corresponding numbers, you take a number from the bucket and find the chair with the matching number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, I ended up in a chair up the front near all the action. I was a couple of metres from where Scott was tied to the chair and placed inside a large three-sided cabinet &ndash; that is, it had no front. Also sitting in the circle were three of the college tutors, Kitty, Eileen and Maureen. It&rsquo;s their job to keep Scott safe; to keep the sitters calm, and to ensure proceedings flow smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All over the floor in front of the cabinet are children&rsquo;s toys and musical instruments, deliberately put there by humans for the spirit children to play with. There was a Daffy Duck stuffed toy, a teddy bear, two small water pistols, a child&rsquo;s plastic xylophone, several drums, a large bell, a harmonica, a ball, a tambourine, skipping rope, a couple of funnel-like trumpets and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HIGH SPIRITS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once everyone is in their seats and the medium is settled in the cabinet, we all holds hands and the lights go off. That&rsquo;s when the music starts. During the first two songs, one of which was&nbsp;<em>Starry, Starry Nights</em>&nbsp;by Don McLean, we&rsquo;re told to keep quiet while Scott goes into the altered trance state that allows the spirit people to use his body and energy to enter our world. Very few people have this ability, physical mediums are a rare breed. Just being your regular run-of-the-mill, talk-to-dead-people medium doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re able to do physical mediumship. The spirit world has told Scott he can do it because of a &ldquo;defect in your brain&rdquo;, UK medium Colin Fry is another one with the ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the third song, the tutors Maureen and Eileen tell the group that Scott is in the trance and we all now need to sing loudly and vigorously to build up the energy and vibration that the spirit world needs to move into our world and do things like pick up the toys, bang the drums and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I won&rsquo;t lie. I&rsquo;m nervous. We&rsquo;re sitting in absolute pitch black with only a sliver of light from the flourescent toys visible. Everyone is holding hands and we&rsquo;ve been told to call out and name and shame anyone who breaks the circle, the idea is to ensure that no living person can get up and move the toys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About half way through singing the first song, gasps are heard around the room as the fluorescent toys start moving. Not just moving randomly though, they&rsquo;re dancing around in time with the music then one by one dumped on the ground &ndash; just like as if a child has got bored with them, which is exactly what&rsquo;s happening according to the tutors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WAKE THE DEAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, it&rsquo;s like a circus has kicked off around my feet. Drums are loudly banged, tamborines are shaken and the xylophone is played. &ldquo;Excellent drumming! What great rhythm! Thank you,&rdquo; people call out to encourage the little spirit musicians to keep playing. Next, people around me are gasping that they&rsquo;re being sprayed with water and then I feel it too, a little squirt of water hitting my knee. Soon, people are saying that they can feel and see little fingers touching their shoulders, legs and hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, I&rsquo;m nervous. I don&rsquo;t want to be touched by spirit children so in my head I ask that they leave me alone. We were told in the preparation lecture that this would be effective. It seemed to work, I wasn&rsquo;t touched at all during the s&eacute;ance even though both of the women sitting either side of me felt the little fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, a young Cockney voice can be heard out of the dark. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello duckie,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;y&rsquo;alright?&rdquo; This is Daniel, one of Scott&rsquo;s spirit helpers (they don&rsquo;t like being called guides apparently, they&rsquo;d rather you called them &lsquo;spirit friends&rsquo; or &lsquo;helpers&rsquo;). Daniel presents himself as a boy for his work with Scott but in fact he was aged in his fifties when he died. Daniel was fond of a drink while on earth but one night as he was leaving the pub he slipped and fell, hitting his head. Unfortunately, because he was a well-known drinker, people just left him on pavement because they thought he was passed out on alcohol. Next thing he knew, his mother was standing over him. &ldquo;What are you doing here Mum? You&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Yes, and now you are too,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Come on, come with me&hellip;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott says that Daniel presents as a boy so that people can better relate to him. Not everyone has been 56 but most people have been the age of nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel is the spirit control who helps the spirits on the other side to communicate with a living person in the room. One of the other spirit children was a little girl that Daniel nicknamed Scrapface, he told us she was in training to do the job of being a control spirit for a physical medium who hasn&rsquo;t been born yet. Daniel is showing her the ropes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While chatting, one of the group asks Daniel &ndash; for some reason &ndash; if there are fish in spirit world. &ldquo;Of course there are,&rdquo; Daniel replies before going on to tell us that everything that lives in our world ends up in his world, including fish and flowers. Daniel is the link between the two worlds because it is apparently extremely difficult for the spirit people to alter their vibration and energy to the degree required to be heard or seen in our world. This is something we&rsquo;d witness for ourselves before the night was over but first there is even freakier stuff for the novice s&eacute;ance attendee to get their head around. Ectoplasm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TOTALLY ECTOPLASMIC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have heard of it if you&rsquo;ve ever seen any of those freaky spiritualist photos from the 1900s. Ectoplasm is the white cotton-wool looking substance that apparently comes out of the medium&rsquo;s body. In the photos, ectoplasm looks static, as if the person is trying to swallow a tablecloth but in fact, Scott tells us, ectoplasm is in constant motion during a s&eacute;ance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ectoplasm is the substance used by the spirit world to show their faces to us and it&rsquo;s the stuff that is used by spirit to create a voice box that hangs in the air not far from the medium. The ectoplasm voice box is used by the loved ones in spirit to talk to their living relatives because, apparently, not all spirits are like Daniel, they are unable to lower their vibrations enough to be heard in our world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the week&rsquo;s course at the College, I&rsquo;d thought ectoplasm was something that had been discredited last century as the stuff of frauds. No, turns out it&rsquo;s alive and well in the world of modern physical mediumship. Ectoplasm itself has even been scientifically analysed. It&rsquo;s made up of various substances that can be found in the human body, which can include red and white blood cells, stomach lining, semen and menstrual blood, as well as matter from the nearby environment such as carpet fibres. Ectoplasm exudes from the body of the medium from any orifice, this could be nose, ears, genitals, belly button and mouth, etc. Apparently, if it comes out of the belly button it smells like boiled cabbage. After the spirit world has retreated, the substance goes back into the body of the medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FRIENDLY GHOSTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some point in the proceedings, a woman called Cathleen who was sat one over from me asked Daniel a question:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cathleen: &ldquo;Daniel, can you see us, even in the dark? What do we look like to you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;Yes Duckie, I can see you, you look like ghosts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not scared of us?&rdquo; [I was joking but Daniel didn&rsquo;t seem to realise.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;No, course not.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;How come we can&rsquo;t see you if you can see us?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel: &ldquo;Because you can&rsquo;t raise your vibration high enough but I can lower my vibration to meet you. I see you as light and colours.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cathleen tried to ask more questions but Daniel apologised and said he had to concentrate on moving the huge cabinet that had Scott in it, tethered to a chair. To move that cabinet, complete with Scott, would take about eight or so living people all working in unison. Even then I can&rsquo;t imagine it being done without a fair bit of commotion, stumbling and creaking. But that cabinet moved several feet &ndash; apparently without physical effort, in pitch black darkness and completely silently. When the lights came on at the end of the night, Scott was now in the middle of the room but still tied to the chair and the cabinet had also been shifted about five feet. This is the kind of proof of the spirit world that spirits like to provide through physical mediums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AFTERLIFE EVIDENCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main point of a s&eacute;ance though, is for someone to talk to a loved one who has passed over. Forget the dancing toys and water pistols, the real reason for holding a s&eacute;ance is to provide evidence of an afterlife and to give comfort or closure to living people still grieving for dead loved ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel introduces the spirit who wants to talk to someone in the group, he starts describing her in the hope that one of the 40 sitters in the room will recognise and claim the spirit person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got big glasses,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and her face went very rosy towards the end. She lost her marbles, she&rsquo;s telling me her thoughts were not her own&hellip; when she had her full bag though she was quite a quick wit, this lady.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A woman named Carol down the far end of the room says she thinks she might know this spirit person. Daniel continues, &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s telling me you were in two minds about coming tonight,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You almost decided to give it a miss,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s telling me you felt her this afternoon&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Just about dinner time,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah Duckie, she was the little voice in your head telling you you had to come tonight. She&rsquo;s telling me you&rsquo;ve got the photos in a carrier bag,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s saying they&rsquo;re in the cupboard, in like a supermarket bag&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Umm&hellip; I can&rsquo;t think&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel in a theatrical whisper reports back to the spirit person: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re bleeding talkin&rsquo; abaht, there&rsquo;s no use telling me stuff she don&rsquo;t know&hellip; [a pause before Daniel turns back to Carol], she&rsquo;s telling me you do have them Duckie.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I do, I do have the photos in a bag in the cupboard. Sorry, you&rsquo;ve got a dozy one!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nah, you ain&rsquo;t dozy Duckie, I put you on the spot. She&rsquo;s saying someone&rsquo;s still got one of her perfume bottles,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my mum.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s saying that you&rsquo;ve had quite a bit of strife this year,&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That the proverbial muck has hit the fan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s very true.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel goes on to talk about letters that Carol&rsquo;s aunt wrote in 1976 and where they were as well as newspaper clippings that that family were holding onto as well as a photo of the aunt wearing a fascinator and gloves that Carol had recently been looking at. All the information was confirmed by Carol and she mentions that the medication her aunt was on before she died had caused her face to turn bright red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then it was time for Carol&rsquo;s aunt to attempt to speak to her niece herself, using the voice box that had apparently formed from the ectoplasm exuding from Scott. I couldn&rsquo;t see this in the pitch black darkness of the room, it&rsquo;s what Scott had told us happens in the preparation lecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Shove yer face innit,&rdquo; Daniel said in a loud whisper to the spirit person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goading her,&rdquo; Daniel explains to the living people in the room, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s having a bit of trouble with it so I&rsquo;m teasing her she can&rsquo;t do it and she&rsquo;s taking it as a challenge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s when we hear labored breathing, wheezing and the kind of noise you&rsquo;d expect to hear from an old person who is having difficulty forming words. The tutors tell Carol to speak to her aunt to encourage her, which is when we discover that the spirit aunt must be French because Carol, a woman from the Channel Islands with a strong English accent, suddenly starts speaking French to the disembodied voice of her dead aunt. I didn&rsquo;t catch all of the conversation but the gist of it was something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Tu peux venir Tante&hellip; Je sais c&rsquo;est difficile pour toi&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Ca va bien?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit Aunty Therese: Ca va. C&rsquo;est pas mal ici.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol: Je t&rsquo;adore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spirit Aunty Therese: Bisou [kiss, kiss, kiss kiss]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also heard from Scott&rsquo;s two other spirit helpers including Eric, an older man with a distinguished British accent as well as Morning Star, a native American Indian who spoke half in English and half in his native tongue. Their voices swirled through the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half way through the s&eacute;ance, there was a brief pause while the red light was turned on and the independents were asked to inspect Scott&rsquo;s fastenings. He was still secured to the chair. I should mention that we can all still hear Daniel&rsquo;s Cockney accent chatting away in the air while the checking of Scott is taking place. Scott is not speaking, he remains in a half trance. It was also a surprise to see that the toys that had started the evening all neatly in one place were now strewn across the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCEPTICS AND SPIRITUALISTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of it all my head was spinning. Did I really just chat with dead people from the spirit world? Did spirit children play musical instruments in front of me, attempting to keep the beat along with our raucous rendition of &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my life&rsquo; by Bon Jovi? And if they did, was it a little insensitive to be belting out lines like, &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t gonna live forever, I&rsquo;m just gonna live while I&rsquo;m alive&hellip;&rsquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do I do with this experience now? Either I believe it all happened and it was as real as it seems or, if that is just too outlandish for my brain to cope with, I can dismiss it all as some extremely elaborate hoax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it that physical mediumship is just so far out in left-field for most people that it&rsquo;s put in the, &ldquo;nah, it just can&rsquo;t be true, that&rsquo;s too insane for my brain to cope with so I&rsquo;m going to ignore it, la la la la la&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve tried describing the experience to friends and family in the wake of my week at the Arthur Findlay College and I can hear the words sounding ridiculous as they come out my mouth. And I see in the eyes of whoever I&rsquo;m talking to betray their thoughts, which range from, &lsquo;wow, she&rsquo;s unbelievably gullible&hellip;&rsquo; to &lsquo;Nah, can&rsquo;t be true, it&rsquo;s a big hoax,&rsquo; and &lsquo;that&rsquo;s utterly ridiculous&rsquo;. A couple of people have tried to keep an open mind but even my husband leans on the side of I&rsquo;ve been bamboozled somehow. His theory is Scott must be some kind of Houdini meets Dynamo character and that a team of people trained in moving silently, all wearing night vision goggles, must be responsible for playing with all the toys and shifting the cabinet with Scott in it. A couple of them must be actors, he reasons, to do the voices of the various spirits we hear in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t blame anyone who hasn&rsquo;t experienced physical mediumship for dismissing it all as a load of rubbish. And without question, there have been fraudster mediums in the past so Spiritualism &ndash; which is an official religion &ndash; does have some bad PR to overcome. However, the Spiritualist community isn&rsquo;t that interested in trying to prove anything to skeptics. If someone is determined not to believe, no amount of evidence will ever be enough, my tutor Maureen tells me. The mediums who tutor at the college are weary of people who are only interested in attending a s&eacute;ance to prove it&rsquo;s a hoax instead of focusing on the messages of love from Spirit and pondering for a minute how it might change their life and outlook if they did know for sure that there is an afterlife; that death is an illusion. For Spiritualists, the aim of all their work is to facilitate communication between this world and the next in order to bring comfort and hope to the souls on both sides who are grieving loved ones or have things left unsaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was there.

Aspen Aman investigates balcony gardens in the UAE.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many people living in the UAE, their balcony or patio is either a great gathering place for friends and family or just another place to battle dust and dirt. But there&rsquo;s another way to view, and use, your balcony or patio that brings beauty, tranquility, relaxation as well as food right into your home &ndash; by creating a garden in this often-neglected space. Gardening saves you money, provides organic food, is a meditative practise, and great for involving children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start Small, Grow Big</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While gardening can seem intimidating to the newcomer, there are plants that are very forgiving to the novice gardener, including cherry tomatoes, mint and other green herbs as well as the hardy aloe vera.&nbsp; As veteran balcony gardener Smitha Lobo-Mascarenhas put it, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t kill a mint!&rdquo;&nbsp; Smitha, who has over 75 small and large plants on her 3.5m x 1.5m balcony in Karama, recommends starting out with kitchen herbs such as the hardy mint, fenugreek, coriander as well as onions, garlic and curry leaf.&nbsp; Scouring the produce section of local stores like Choithrams and Lulu, Smitha is constantly on the lookout for ginger, lemongrass, garlic, beetroot and the like that are sprouting.&nbsp; She recommends using the sprouting plants as an easy and inexpensive way to get starter plants&nbsp; for your balcony garden.&nbsp; Spices such as coriander and fenugreek &ndash; found in the spice aisle of your local supermarket &ndash; can also be made to sprout to produce seedlings for your own kitchen herbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laura Allais-Mar&eacute;, founder of the Balcony and Urban Gardening in the UAE group, advocates keeping your gardening &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; &ndash; by which she means reusing existing containers (like yoghurt cups and water bottles for sprouting seeds) and inexpensive potting soil mixtures (see sidebar &lsquo;Laura&rsquo;s Magic Potting Soil Mix&rsquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;My garden may not be elegant,&rdquo; Laura says, &ldquo;because so many of my plants are growing in re-purposed yoghurt cups, but the plants are beautiful<em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Passionately committed to growing good food and fostering awareness of the connection between the earth, people and food, Laura established the balcony gardening group upon her arrival in the UAE in 2013.&nbsp; The group now has nearly 300 gardener members, roughly split between experienced and new gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How and When to Start Your Balcony/Patio Garden &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With temperate winter months and scorching summers, Dubai&rsquo;s optimal growiing&nbsp; season starts in October/November, with plants thriving on patios and balconies January-early April.&nbsp; Karteeka Tayyagi, a balcony gardener for the past eight years, recommends starting with soil preparation in October/November.&nbsp; She suggests cleaning the pots/containers with a mild cleaning solution and drying them in the sun to kill any molds/funghi or other pathogens left from the previous growing season.&nbsp; Karteeka mixes her old soil with fresh potting soil, chicken manure pellets, humus and red sand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Karteeka and Smitha encourage beginners to work with seedlings or plants you already know before moving on to more exotic (and usually more expensive) plants.&nbsp; Karteeka recommends sprouting seeds indoors and repotting seedlings when the plant grows three sets of leaves.&nbsp; After seedlings are repotted, you can move them to your balcony or patio &ndash; paying close attention to wind and sun conditions.&nbsp; Morning sun, per Smitha&rsquo;s experience here in Dubai, is best for young plants and most varities, as afternoon sun can be very harsh.&nbsp; Karteeka cites strong winds &ndash; as often come to high-rise balconies in areas like JLT or Old Town &ndash; as big challenges for balcony gardeners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the plants grow and reach maturity, you can begin to harvest the herbs, vegetables and fruit you&rsquo;ve planted.&nbsp; Many herbs thrive on multiple cuttings &ndash; especially mint &mdash; while some veggies must be harvested at a particular time.&nbsp; As any devoted gardener will tell you, seeds are essential to maintaining your future stock of plants &ndash; so invest in quality, organic and non-GMO seeds to ensure the best possible variety of plants and to maintain biodiversity and heirloom varieties.&nbsp; As the summer months approach, it is time to&nbsp; cull the spent plants and move those that won&rsquo;t survive the outdoor heat.&nbsp; Collect the soil from your containers and store in sealed plastic containers until the next growing season.&nbsp; (Microwaving soil is a great way to kill pathogens and return it to a soft texture, recommends Karteeka.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The keys to successful container gardening &ndash; either on your patio or balcony &ndash; comes down to a few essentials:&nbsp; appropriate amount/strength of sunlight, proper watering, pruning and love for your garden. The most common mistakes new gardeners make?&nbsp; Over-watering their plants and not being patient enough with their plants.&nbsp; Many varieties need plenty of time for their seeds to sprout and seedlings to grow; give your plants time and you&rsquo;ll harvest the rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Balcony and Urban Gardening in the UAE group meets once a month to swap seeds and seedlings, exchange tips and socialise; you can join this group to gain a valuable network of gardening gurus adept at creating bountiful, beautiful gardens in small spaces here in the UAE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where to get your gardening stuff</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Warsan Nurseries &ndash; past Dragon Mart &ndash; is a large collection of nurseries staffed by very experienced nursery staff who can help you with seedlings, plants, soil, pots and more.&nbsp; Blue Planet Green People in JLT is another great source of organic seeds and gardening supplies.&nbsp; You can also create your own compost for your soil and collect your own seeds from the organic produce available at several organic shops and markets in Dubai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plants for your summer balcony or patio</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With some good old TLC (tender, loving care), attention and proper watering, some varieties of plants do well &ndash; and actually thrive &ndash; in the intense UAE summer months on balconies and patios. Give these ones a try: Bougainvillea, Desert Rose (Adenium), Aloe Vera, Ixora, Mint, Jade Plant, Curry Leaf Plant (Murraya koenigii).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expert Tips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 1:&nbsp; Black pots will get extremely hot in the summer, so make sure you repot all of your plants into non-black pots.&nbsp; Plastic pots are better for plants outdoors in the summer as they retain water better than porous clay pots but each type of plant will have its specific requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 2:&nbsp; Some plants have highly toxic parts.&nbsp; All parts of the Desert Rose and Oleander, for example, are highly toxic, so keep children and pets away from these plants.&nbsp; When in doubt, check for potential toxicity before adding new plants to your garden, if you have young children or inquisitive pets at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip 3:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t water your plants in direct sun!&nbsp; Especially during the summer months because the wet leaves can actually burn and turn brown if wetted in direct, intense sunlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Laura&rsquo;s Magic Potting Soil Mix</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>&bull; 60-70 per cent red desert sand (from interior desert, not the beach)</li>\r\n	<li>&bull; 25-35 per cent potting soil</li>\r\n	<li>&bull; 5-10 per cent&nbsp; organic material (chicken manure pellets, compost, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For the sake of sustainability, don&rsquo;t use peat.&nbsp; A non-renewable resource, peat is an ancient form of soil found only in limited parts of the world. Peat harvesting has had devastating ecological impact on the local biosphere.&nbsp; Some local gardeners use &lsquo;coconut peat&rsquo; (aka coconut coir) as a mulch or component in your potting soil to help retain moisture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Great gardening resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are literally thousands of gardening websites, videos and social media groups online. Gardeners at all levels will inspiration at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.plantcaretoday.com/\">www.plantcaretoday.com</a>, which links to balcony/patio gardening projects like growing carrots in a bucket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get tips on how to garden in Dubai&rsquo;s climate, swap seeds and plants and just talk gardening with other balcony and patio gardeners here in the UAE, check out the Balcony and Urban Gardening in the UAE Facebook group (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/B.G.G.Dubai/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/B.G.G.Dubai/</a>) and Expat Woman&rsquo;s gardening pages (<a href=\"http://www.expatwoman.com/dubai/monthly_gardens_gardening.aspx\">http://www.expatwoman.com/dubai/monthly_gardens_gardening.aspx</a>) as well as Agriculture Box at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.agriculturebox.com/\">www.agriculturebox.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HOW GARDENING SAVES YOUR LIFE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Most of us know that gardening is somehow good for us but let&rsquo;s look at exactly how it can improve your life:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gardening saves your money.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; With easy-to-grow vegetables like tomatoes and herbs like basil and mint, you can save a bit on your grocery bill while knowing&nbsp;<em>exactly&nbsp;</em>where those veggies and herbs came from.&nbsp; As your skills increase, you can graduate to a wider variety of edibles that you can grow right on your own balcony or patio, thereby decreasing your food bill even more. &nbsp; As one community gardner put it, &ldquo;growing your own food is like printing money!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gardening saves your sanity</em></strong>.&nbsp; Gardening is both a wonderful solitary, meditative activity and a sociable way to meet new people and have fun with family and friends.&nbsp; The daily act of taking care of your plants and seedlings allows you to express your nuturing energies, while self-reflecting, problem-solving, and reconnecting to nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gardening saves your health</em></strong>.&nbsp; The act of planning, planting and caring for your plants can powerfully impact your health through the increased amount of exercise you get (even small gardens), reduction in stress hormones like cortisol, reduction in blood pressure and reduced risk from osteoporosis, diabetes and other modern ills.&nbsp; Studies conducted in the US revealed that women who gardened had overall lesser risk of osteoporosis than women who exercised through jogging, aerobics or swimming.&nbsp; Conditions as diverse as diabetes, depression, arthritis, insomnia and obesity have less severe symptoms or impact on individuals who garden regularly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gardening saves your brain. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>In addition to the protection your brain gets through overall better health you gain from gardening, the brains of long-term gardeners are more resilient and less prone to dementia.&nbsp; Medical researchers following gardeners in their 60s and 70s for a period of 16 years found that these seniors had a 36 per cent and 47 per cent lower risk of dementia than their non-gardening peers.&nbsp; Gardening or being in gardens also seems to help individuals suffering from dementia and Alzheimers by providing them restful, natural surroundings in which they can connect and de-stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Gardening saves your planet.&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;When you eat what you grow, you&rsquo;re eating the freshest food possible.&nbsp; No trucking or flying in those cherry tomatoes that grew on your patio.&nbsp; Gardening includes a whole cycle of practices that make us more mindful of the earth and our impact on it.&nbsp; Planting vegetables, herbs, flowers and trees creates an intimate connection between us and our planet &ndash; and makes us more aware of our overall impact upon the earth.&nbsp; Practices such as organic gardening reduce the amount of pesticides and chemical fertilisers loaded on to our ecosystem; composting our kitchen scraps (fruit/veggie skins, eggshells, coffee grounds and tea bags, to name a few) positively contributes to saving the planet by keeping biomass out of the landfills and returning it to revitalise the soil.</p>\r\n', 'balcony-garden-2-e1424108037188.jpg', '2019-07-31 06:58:18');
